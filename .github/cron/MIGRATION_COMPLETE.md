# âœ… Migration Complete: Fly.io â†’ GitHub Actions

This document summarizes what was removed and changed during the complete migration from Fly.io scheduled machines to GitHub Actions cron jobs.

## Migration Date

October 24, 2025

## What Was Removed

### Fly.io Deployment Scripts

These scripts are no longer needed:

- âœ… Deleted: `scripts/deploy-cron-jobs.sh` - Fly.io machine deployment
- âœ… Deleted: `scripts/diagnose-cron.sh` - Fly.io diagnostic tool
- âœ… Deleted: `scripts/check-cron-health.sh` - Fly.io health monitoring
- âœ… Deleted: `scripts/test-cron-remote.sh` - Old endpoint testing script

### Fly.io Testing & Monitoring Scripts (in root)

- âœ… Deleted: `test-cron-endpoint.sh` - Old test script
- âœ… Deleted: `check-cron-status.sh` - Fly.io status checker

### Docker/Container Configuration (Fly.io-specific)

- âœ… Deleted: `crontab` - Supercronic crontab file
- âœ… Modified: `Dockerfile` - Removed Supercronic installation and crontab copying

### Old Fly.io Documentation Files

The following Fly.io-focused documentation has been removed and replaced with GitHub Actions docs:

- âœ… Deleted: `CRON_SETUP_SUMMARY.md`
- âœ… Deleted: `CRON_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`
- âœ… Deleted: `CRON_DEBUG_SUMMARY.md`
- âœ… Deleted: `CRON-MONITORING.md`
- âœ… Deleted: `EMAIL_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md`
- âœ… Deleted: `EMAIL_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md`

- âœ… Deleted: `TESTING_QUICK_START.md`
- âœ… Deleted: `WEEKLY_DIGEST_QUICKSTART.md`
- âœ… Deleted: `WHATS_NEW_WEEKLY_DIGEST.md`

## What Was Updated

### Configuration Files

1. **`fly.toml`**
   - Updated comments to reflect cron jobs are now in GitHub Actions
   - Removed references to `scripts/deploy-cron-jobs.sh`
   - Note: Kept fly.toml as it's still used for Fly.io deployment

2. **`Dockerfile`**
   - Removed Supercronic installation (lines 56-69)
   - Removed `COPY crontab` command (line 75)
   - Kept rest of Docker config for Fly.io web app deployment

### Scripts (Updated with Deprecation Notices)

These scripts are no longer called by the automated cron system, but kept for manual testing:

1. **`scripts/send-reminders.ts`**
   - Added deprecation notice
   - Points to HTTP endpoint: `GET /api/cron/send-reminders` (Daily 9 AM UTC)
   - Can still be run manually: `tsx scripts/send-reminders.ts`

2. **`scripts/send-founder-emails.ts`**
   - Added deprecation notice
   - Points to HTTP endpoint: `GET /api/cron/founder-emails` (Daily 2 PM UTC)
   - Can still be run manually: `tsx scripts/send-founder-emails.ts`

3. **`scripts/send-weekly-digest.ts`**
   - Added deprecation notice
   - Points to HTTP endpoint: `GET /api/cron/weekly-digest` (Monday 10 AM UTC)
   - Can still be run manually: `tsx scripts/send-weekly-digest.ts`

4. **`scripts/send-weekly-stats.ts`**
   - Added deprecation notice
   - Points to HTTP endpoint: `GET /api/cron/weekly-stats` (Monday 11 AM UTC)
   - Can still be run manually: `tsx scripts/send-weekly-stats.ts`

## What Was Created (New GitHub Actions Setup)

### New API Endpoints (Fully Functional)

All endpoints authenticate with Bearer token and trigger email services:

1. **`src/routes/api/cron/send-reminders/+server.ts`** âœ…
   - HTTP GET endpoint
   - Calls `EmailReminderService`
   - Supports dry-run and test email modes

2. **`src/routes/api/cron/founder-emails/+server.ts`** âœ…
   - HTTP GET and POST endpoints
   - Calls `FounderEmailService`
   - Supports manual testing with POST

3. **`src/routes/api/cron/weekly-digest/+server.ts`** âœ…
   - HTTP GET endpoint
   - Calls `WeeklyUpdatesEmailService`
   - Content configured inline (update each week)

4. **`src/routes/api/cron/weekly-stats/+server.ts`** âœ…
   - HTTP GET endpoint
   - Calls `WeeklyStatsEmailService`
   - Personalized stats generation

### New GitHub Actions Workflow

**`.github/workflows/cron-jobs.yml`** âœ…

- 4 scheduled jobs (send-reminders, founder-emails, weekly-digest, weekly-stats)
- Manual trigger support for testing
- Proper curl error handling
- Each job runs independently

### New Documentation

All in `.github/cron/`:

1. **`README.md`** - Complete overview and setup guide
2. **`API_REFERENCE.md`** - Detailed endpoint documentation with examples
3. **`QUICK_START.md`** - Fast reference for common tasks
4. **`MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`** - Why/what/how of the migration
5. **`MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md`** - This file

## Architecture Comparison

### Old: Fly.io Scheduled Machines

```
GitHub/GitOps â†’ fly.toml â†’ Fly.io Machines
                        â†“
                   crontab file
                   Supercronic daemon
                   â””â†’ tsx scripts/...ts
```

### New: GitHub Actions with HTTP Endpoints

```
GitHub Actions Workflow â†’ curl â†’ https://trykaiwa.com/api/cron/*
                               â†“
                          HTTP Endpoint (SvelteKit)
                          â””â†’ Email Service
```

## Benefits Achieved

âœ… **No extra infrastructure** - Crons run on the main app server
âœ… **Version controlled** - Schedules in `.github/workflows/` are git-tracked
âœ… **Better monitoring** - GitHub Actions UI shows runs and logs
âœ… **Easier testing** - Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI
âœ… **Simpler deployment** - No separate `fly deploy` needed
âœ… **Cleaner codebase** - Old Fly.io-specific files removed
âœ… **HTTP-based** - Can test endpoints with curl
âœ… **Flexible scaling** - Doesn't require separate Fly.io machines

## Files Status Summary

- 4 Fly.io scripts
- 2 test scripts
- 1 crontab

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Delete Fly.io scheduled machines (if still running)

   ```bash
   fly machines list --app kaiwa | grep cron
   # Then remove with: fly machines delete &lt;machine-id&gt;
   ```

2. âœ… Verify GitHub Actions workflow is running
   - Go to Actions â†’ Scheduled Cron Jobs
   - Check recent runs

3. âœ… Monitor first scheduled run
   - Daily reminders: 9 AM UTC
   - Check GitHub Actions UI for success

4. âœ… Update weekly digest content weekly
   - Edit `src/routes/api/cron/weekly-digest/+server.ts`
   - Update before Monday 10 AM UTC

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to revert:

1. This git commit includes all migration changes
2. Revert the commit to restore old files
3. Re-enable Fly.io scheduled machines
