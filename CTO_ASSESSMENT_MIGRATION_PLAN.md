```

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] Clean SvelteKit setup with TypeScript
- [ ] Functional event system implementation
- [ ] **Anonymous trial experience (2-min conversations)**
- [ ] **Google OAuth integration**
- [ ] Core UI components
- [ ] Development environment setup

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 3-6)

**Priority Order**:

1. **Trial to Auth Conversion** (Google OAuth flow)
2. **Audio Recording/Playback** (core functionality)
3. **Real-time Communication** (WebSocket/WebRTC)
4. **Conversation Management** (business logic)
5. **Progress Tracking** (user engagement)

**Deliverables**:

- [ ] **Seamless trial-to-auth conversion flow**
- [ ] **Unlimited conversations for authenticated users**
- [ ] Audio capture and playback
- [ ] Real-time conversation capability
- [ ] **Conversation history and progress tracking**
- [ ] Basic responsive UI

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)

**Focus**: Value-add features and polish

1. **Analysis & Feedback**
2. **Gamification Elements**
3. **Social Features**
4. **Performance Optimization**

### Phase 4: Data Migration & Launch (Week 9)

**Goal**: Seamless transition from v1 to v2

- [ ] User data migration
- [ ] Conversation history (if needed)
- [ ] Subscription/payment data
- [ ] DNS/deployment switch
- [ ] v1 deprecation plan

## 🏗️ New Architecture Principles

### 1. Feature-First Design

```typescript
// Each feature is completely self-contained
export interface FeatureModule {
	services: Record<string, Service>;
	components: Record<string, Component>;
	events: EventDefinitions;
	init: () => Promise<void>;
	cleanup: () => void;
}
```

### 2. Event-Driven Communication

```typescript
// No direct imports between features, ever
audioFeature.events.emit('recording.started', { sessionId });
conversationFeature.events.on('recording.started', handleRecording);
```

### 3. Functional Programming Core

```typescript
// Pure functions, immutable state, Result types
const processAudio = (audioData: ArrayBuffer): Result<Transcription, Error> => {
	// Pure, testable, predictable
};
```

### 4. Progressive Enhancement

- **Core First**: Basic functionality works without JavaScript
- **Enhanced Experience**: Progressive enhancement for advanced features
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design from day 1

## ⚡ Time & ROI Analysis

### Current Path (Fixing Legacy)

```
├── Week 1-4: Continue untangling dependencies
├── Week 5-8: Fix runtime errors
├── Week 9-12: Stabilize and test
└── Result: Still fragile, hard to maintain
```

### Fresh Start Path

```
├── Week 1-2: Clean architecture setup
├── Week 3-6: Rebuild core features (faster, cleaner)
├── Week 7-8: Advanced features & polish
├── Week 9: Migration & launch
└── Result: Modern, maintainable, scalable
```

## 🎯 What to Keep vs. Rebuild

### ✅ Keep (Copy Over)

- **UI Components**: Svelte components (with cleanup)
- **Business Logic**: Core conversation flow concepts
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS/DaisyUI setup
- **API Endpoints**: Clean server-side logic
- **Database Schema**: User and conversation data

### ❌ Rebuild (Fresh)

- **Service Layer**: All services with clean interfaces
- **State Management**: Functional stores from scratch
- **Feature Integration**: Event-driven from day 1
- **Component Integration**: Props-based, no direct imports
- **Build Configuration**: Modern tooling setup

## 🚀 Immediate Action Plan

### This Week

1. **Create `kaiwa-v2` repository**
2. **Set up SvelteKit + TypeScript + functional architecture**
3. **Implement core event system**
4. **Build anonymous trial experience (2-min conversations)**
5. **Create compelling landing page with instant trial**

### Success Metrics

- **Week 2**: Anonymous trial + Google auth working
- **Week 4**: Full conversation features for authenticated users
- **Week 6**: Advanced features and analytics
- **Week 8**: Monetization features and optimization
- **Week 9**: Migration complete

## 🔄 Risk Mitigation

### Fallback Strategy

- Keep current app running during v2 development
- Gradual user migration (opt-in beta)
- Feature flags for A/B testing
- Rollback plan if issues arise

### Quality Assurance

- **Automated Testing**: Unit tests for all pure functions
- **Integration Testing**: Event system and feature interactions
- **Performance Testing**: Audio/real-time performance benchmarks
- **User Testing**: Alpha user feedback loop

## 💡 Key Learnings to Carry Forward

### Technical Lessons

1. **Feature Isolation**: Never allow direct cross-feature imports
2. **Event-Driven**: All inter-feature communication via events
3. **Functional Programming**: Pure functions for predictable behavior
4. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript throughout
5. **Testing First**: Write tests before implementation

### Process Lessons

1. **Architecture First**: Establish patterns before building features
2. **Documentation**: Keep architecture decisions documented
3. **Incremental**: Build and test features incrementally
4. **User Feedback**: Regular user testing and feedback integration

## 📚 Documentation Strategy

### Create These Docs

- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and principles
- [ ] `FEATURE_GUIDE.md` - How to build new features
- [ ] `EVENT_SYSTEM.md` - Event-driven communication patterns
- [ ] `MIGRATION_LOG.md` - Lessons learned and decisions made
- [ ] `API_REFERENCE.md` - Service interfaces and contracts
- [ ] `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Environment setup and deployment process

## 🎯 Conclusion

**Recommendation**: Proceed with strategic rewrite.

**Rationale**: The current codebase has reached a point where technical debt exceeds feature velocity. A fresh start with our proven architecture will deliver a more maintainable, scalable product in less time than continuing to fix legacy issues.

**Next Steps**:

1. Approve migration plan
2. Set up v2 repository
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Establish weekly progress reviews
