# 🎉 What's New: Weekly Digest System

## What Was Added

I've set up a complete weekly digest email system for you! Here's what's new:

### ✅ New Files Created

1. **`scripts/send-weekly-digest.ts`** - Cron job script
   - Sends weekly digest every Monday at 10am UTC
   - Easy to update with new content each week
   - Test with: `pnpm cron:weekly-digest`

2. **`src/routes/dev/weekly-digest/+page.svelte`** - Admin UI
   - Beautiful admin page to compose weekly emails
   - Preview emails before sending
   - Copy content to script with one click
   - Access at: https://trykaiwa.com/dev/weekly-digest

3. **`src/routes/api/admin/weekly-digest/`** - API endpoints
   - `preview/+server.ts` - Generate email preview
   - `send/+server.ts` - Send digest to all subscribers

4. **`kaiwa-founder-reminders.ics`** - Calendar file
   - Import into Google/Apple/Outlook Calendar
   - Automatic reminders for all founder tasks:
     - Sunday 3pm: Update weekly digest
     - Monday 11am: Check digest sent
     - Daily: Monitor automated emails
     - Friday 6pm: Weekly health check
     - Monthly: Consider product updates

5. **Documentation**
   - `EMAIL_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide
   - `EMAIL_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference
   - `WEEKLY_DIGEST_QUICKSTART.md` - Sunday routine

### ✅ Files Updated

1. **`scripts/deploy-cron-jobs.sh`**
   - Added weekly digest cron deployment
   - Now deploys 3 cron jobs instead of 2

2. **`package.json`**
   - Added `"cron:weekly-digest": "tsx scripts/send-weekly-digest.ts"`
   - Test locally with: `pnpm cron:weekly-digest`

## How It Works

### Your Weekly Workflow (5-10 minutes)

**Sunday Evening** (or whenever you have time):

1. Visit https://trykaiwa.com/dev/weekly-digest
2. Fill in what you shipped this week (2-4 items)
3. Add any product highlights or upcoming features
4. Click "Copy to Script"
5. Paste into `scripts/send-weekly-digest.ts`
6. Commit and push

**Monday 10am UTC**:

- Cron job automatically sends to all subscribed users
- System pulls user stats (practice time, streak, etc.)
- Respects user email preferences

**Monday 11am UTC**:

- Check logs to verify it sent successfully
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery stats
