## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Kaiwa is built on a **Clean 3-Layer Architecture** (Services ‚Üí Stores ‚Üí UI) and is migrating towards a **Feature-Sliced Design** to enhance scalability and maintainability.

- **Services**: Pure, isolated business logic.
- **Stores**: Svelte 5 runes-based state management and service orchestration.
- **UI**: Thin, declarative Svelte components.
- **Features**: Encapsulated feature modules with their own components, services, and stores.

For a detailed explanation, please see the [Architecture Documentation](src/lib/docs/architecture.md).
