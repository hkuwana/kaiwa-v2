						Core Principle: Signal vs. Noise
					</p>
					<p>
						Our Signal is simple: giving users the specific, practiced skills to have a single, successful, high-stakes conversation with a loved one.
					</p>
					<p>
						We ignore the noise: gamification for its own sake, generic "soft skills" training, metrics like "time in app."
					</p>
					<p class="mt-6 font-semibold text-white">
						We built Kaiwa by working backwards from the user's real-world emotional goal.
					</p>
					<p>
						The user does not want to "practice AI conversations." The user wants their parents to be proud. Wants their partner to understand them. Wants to be in the room, fully present, without translating.
					</p>
					<p>
						So we built four phases:
					</p>
					<ul class="mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-300">
						<li><strong>Phase 1: User Acquisition</strong> — We market the solution to emotional problems, not features</li>
						<li><strong>Phase 2: User Onboarding</strong> — We prove value instantly by helping with their specific conversation fear</li>
						<li><strong>Phase 3: User Retention</strong> — We use engagement only to encourage deeper practice of what matters</li>
						<li><strong>Phase 4: Real-World Bridge</strong> — We celebrate the real conversation outcomes that prove this works</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold text-white">
						Welcome to Kaiwa. The app for people who need to connect, not just pass a test.
