				<div class="space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
					<p>
						I always loved learning languages, but I struggled with traditional methods. Like millions of others, I tried Duolingo, attended formal classes, and memorized vocabulary lists. But I never built real confidence until I actually talked to native speakers. Despite growing up bilingual in Japanese and Chinese, my breakthrough with learning foreign languages only came when I immersed myself in real conversations during my time in Taiwan.
					</p>
					<p>
						Within 2 months of living in Taiwan, something clicked. I became conversational, played
						Mahjong with my host family, talked about life and school. It wasn't because I suddenly
						mastered grammar rules‚Äîit was because I fell in love with the learning process through
						real conversations.
					</p>
					<p>
						That's when I realized: each language is like an opening to an experience. Sure, you
						need to memorize vocabulary sometimes, but the most important part is building the
						confidence to actually use it with real people.
					</p>
					<p class="font-semibold">
						Most language apps prepare you for tests, not for touching people's hearts.

						Kaiwa is an AI language learning platform designed for people who want to build real communication skills through conversation practice. Unlike traditional language apps that focus on vocabulary drills and grammar exercises, we prioritize the conversations that actually matter‚Äîthe ones that create human connections and lasting memories.
					</p>
					<p>
						We recognize that AI will soon handle routine translations for business emails and basic interactions. But when you're laughing with friends in an izakaya in Tokyo, sharing personal stories at a tapas bar in Granada, or having heart-to-heart conversations with your in-laws in their native tongue‚Äîthat's when you touch people's hearts, not just exchange information.
					</p>
					<p class="font-semibold">
						These authentic, emotional moments are what keep the human element of communication alive. Kaiwa helps you practice for these real-world scenarios through AI-powered conversation practice that prepares you for meaningful human connection.

				<h2 class="mb-6 text-3xl font-bold">Why This Matters</h2>
				<div class="space-y-4 leading-relaxed">
					<p>
						Language learning isn't really about the language‚Äîit's about the doors it opens. When
						you can laugh with strangers at a local cafe, comfort someone in their mother tongue, or
						share your thoughts without needing translation, you create experiences that stick with
						you.
					</p>
					<p>
						We believe the people who use Kaiwa won't just "know" a language‚Äîthey'll live it.
						They'll build relationships that wouldn't have existed otherwise and create memories
						that make all the practice worth it.
					</p>
					<p class="text-lg font-semibold">
						Because the best part of learning a language isn't the learning‚Äîit's what becomes
						possible afterward.
