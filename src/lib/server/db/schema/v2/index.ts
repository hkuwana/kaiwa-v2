/**
 * ðŸš€ V2 Database Schemas - Advanced features planned for future implementation
 *
 * This directory contains enhanced schema definitions that extend beyond the MVP functionality.
 * These schemas are organized here to keep the main schema directory focused on core features
 * while providing a roadmap for future development. They include advanced learning analytics,
 * detailed conversation tracking, and enhanced user experience features.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - ðŸ“Š Advanced learning analytics and progress tracking
 * - ðŸŽ¯ Sophisticated vocabulary and spaced repetition systems
 * - ðŸ’¬ Enhanced conversation session management
 * - ðŸ”” Advanced notification and user experience features
 * - ðŸ“ˆ Comprehensive usage analytics and reporting
 *
 * **Implementation Roadmap:**
 * 1. ðŸŽ¯ **userLearningStats** - After basic progress tracking is stable
 * 2. ðŸ“š **vocabularyProgress** - After conversation system is solid
 * 3. ðŸ’¬ **conversationSessions** - After basic conversation tracking is stable
 * 4. ðŸ”” **userNotifications** - After core features are complete
 *
 * **Note**: Scenario tracking (attempts & outcomes) has been replaced with simplified
 * scenario-metadata.ts and user-scenario-progress.ts in the main schema directory.
 *
 * **Migration Strategy:**
 * - ðŸ”„ Gradual migration from v1 to v2 schemas
 * - ðŸ“Š Data migration scripts will be provided
 * - ðŸ§ª A/B testing support for new features
 * - ðŸ“ˆ Performance monitoring and optimization
