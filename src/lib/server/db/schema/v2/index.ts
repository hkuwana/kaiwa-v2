// V2 Database Schemas - Advanced Features for Future Implementation
// These schemas are moved here to keep the MVP clean and focused
// They will be gradually added back as the application grows

// Advanced Learning Analytics
export { userLearningStats } from './userLearningStats';
export { vocabularyProgress } from './vocabularyProgress';

// Conversation Analytics (Moved from MVP for simplicity)
export { conversationSessions } from './conversationSessions';

// Scenario Management
export { scenarioAttempts } from './scenarioAttempts';
export { scenarioOutcomes } from './scenarioOutcomes';

// User Experience & Notifications
export { userNotifications } from './userNotifications';
export { userUsage } from './userUsage';

// Implementation Priority:
// 1. userLearningStats - After basic progress tracking is stable
// 2. vocabularyProgress - After conversation system is solid
// 3. conversationSessions - After basic conversation tracking is stable
// 4. scenarioAttempts - After basic scenarios are working
// 5. userNotifications - After core features are complete
