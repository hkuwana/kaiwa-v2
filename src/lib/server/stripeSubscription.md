Read our guide on [manually requesting 3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow.md#manual-three-ds) for more information on how this configuration interacts with Radar and our SCA Engine.

    Possible enum values: - `any`

To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).

Stripe can’t guarantee your preference because the issuer determines the ultimate authentication flow. To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).

This is a terminal status, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated.

  A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over.

  A subscription can only enter a `paused` status [when a trial ends without a payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/trials.md#create-free-trials-without-payment). A `paused` subscription doesn’t generate invoices and can be resumed after your customer adds their payment method. The `paused` status is different from [pausing collection](https://docs.stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment.md), which still generates invoices and leaves the subscription’s status unchanged.

  If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically`, it becomes `past_due` when payment is required but cannot be paid (due to failed payment or awaiting additional user actions). Once Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts, the subscription will become `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings).

  If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.

- `test_clock` (string, nullable)
  ID of the test clock this subscription belongs to.

- `transfer_data` (object, nullable)
  The account (if any) the subscription’s payments will be attributed to for tax reporting, and where funds from each payment will be transferred to for each of the subscription’s invoices.
  - `transfer_data.amount_percent` (float, nullable)
    A non-negative decimal between 0 and 100, with at most two decimal places. This represents the percentage of the subscription invoice total that will be transferred to the destination account. By default, the entire amount is transferred to the destination.

  - `transfer_data.destination` (string)
    The account where funds from the payment will be transferred to upon payment success.

- `trial_end` (timestamp, nullable)
  If the subscription has a trial, the end of that trial.

- `trial_settings` (object, nullable)
  Settings related to subscription trials.
  - `trial_settings.end_behavior` (object)
    Defines how the subscription should behave when the user’s free trial ends.

        - `trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method` (enum)
          Indicates how the subscription should change when the trial ends if the user did not provide a payment method.

    Possible enum values: - `cancel`
    Cancel the subscription if a payment method is not attached when the trial ends.

          - `create_invoice`
            Create an invoice when the trial ends, even if the user did not set up a payment method.

          - `pause`
            Pause the subscription if a payment method is not attached when the trial ends.

- `trial_start` (timestamp, nullable)
  If the subscription has a trial, the beginning of that trial.
