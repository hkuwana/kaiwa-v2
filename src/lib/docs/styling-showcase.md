# 🎨 Markdown Styling Showcase

> **Welcome to the enhanced markdown experience!** This document demonstrates all the beautiful styling improvements we've made to make your documentation more readable and professional.

---

## 🎯 Typography Hierarchy

### Main Heading (H1)

This is a **main heading** with enhanced styling including a subtle border and proper spacing.

### Secondary Heading (H2)

This secondary heading has a lighter border and maintains visual hierarchy.

#### Tertiary Heading (H3)

Tertiary headings use a **primary color** to create visual interest.

##### Quaternary Heading (H4)

Fourth-level headings maintain readability while being visually distinct.

###### Quinary Heading (H5)

Fifth-level headings are perfect for subsections.

###### Senary Heading (H6)

Sixth-level headings are the smallest but still clearly defined.

## 📝 Text Formatting

### Basic Text Elements

- **Bold text** for emphasis and important information
- _Italic text_ for subtle emphasis and foreign terms
- `Inline code` for technical terms and commands
- ~~Strikethrough~~ for removed or deprecated content
- <mark>Highlighted text</mark> for important notes

### Enhanced Paragraphs

This paragraph demonstrates improved spacing and readability. The text flows naturally with proper line height and margins, making it easy to read long-form content.

Another paragraph shows consistent spacing between elements, creating a clean and professional appearance throughout the document.

## 💻 Code Styling

### Inline Code

Use `npm install` or `pnpm add` to install packages. The `code` element now has better padding and borders.

### Code Blocks

```typescript
interface User {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	email: string;
	tier: UserTier;
}

class UserService {
	async createUser(userData: CreateUserData): Promise<User> {
		const user = new User(crypto.randomUUID(), userData.name, userData.email, userData.tier);

		await this.repository.save(user);
		return user;
	}
}
```

### JSON Examples

```json
{
	"success": true,
	"data": {
		"user": {
			"id": "user_123",
			"name": "John Doe",
			"email": "john@example.com"
		}
	},
	"timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
