**The Hook**:
"Your partner/family only knows 30% of who you are.
The funny you. The thoughtful you. The real you.
It's all trapped behind language.
Every day you wait, they fall more in love with a simplified version of you.
Every family dinner, you become more of a stranger.
Every fight in their second language, you lose.
7 days to show them the other 70%.
No grammar. No tests. Just you, finally translated."

**[Start Your 70% Week]**

## üî• The Brutal Truth

People in relationships don't have a language problem. They have a **connection emergency**. Every mistranslation is a small betrayal. Every family gathering where they can't participate is a reminder they don't belong.

We're not teaching language. We're **saving relationships from slow death by Google Translate**.

The urgency is real: Every day they wait, they drift further from the people they love.

That's not philosophy. That's fact. And that's what we sell.
