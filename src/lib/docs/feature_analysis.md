# ðŸ§  Analysis Feature Guide

> **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Full implementation with real OpenAI processing

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The Analysis Feature provides comprehensive language learning assessment and feedback. It uses a clean 3-Layer Architecture, CEFR-to-practical level mapping, modular analysis, and real OpenAI processing for intelligent feedback.

### Architecture Philosophy

- **Backend-Heavy Processing**: Complex analysis happens server-side.
- **Confidence-First**: The experience is designed to build learner confidence.
- **Modular Design**: The system is extensible with new analysis modules.

## ðŸ§ª Analysis Modules

- **Text-Based Modules**: Quick stats, grammar and phrase suggestions, fluency analysis, and language level assessment.
- **Audio-Based Modules (Premium)**: Pronunciation analysis and speech rhythm.

## ðŸ“ˆ Incremental Growth Plan

This feature will be shipped incrementally:

1.  **Foundation (Week 0)**: Scaffold the `GrowthPlaybookService`, `analysis.store`, and `GrowthPlaybookCard` component.
2.  **Signals & Instrumentation (Week 1)**: Implement the Scenario Mastery API, track usage cadence, and add component snapshot tests.
3.  **Persona Dial & Copy (Week 2)**: Add a persona selector in the UI and A/B test share prompts.
4.  **Scenario Launch Loop (Week 3)**: Wire the Growth Playbook CTA to launch the next recommended scenario.
5.  **Reminders & Share Nudges (Week 4)**: Connect the `ReminderScheduler` to use playbook data for personalized nudges.

## ðŸ“š Logbook Data Model

The logbook tracks learner progress in a structured way:

- `linguistic_features`: A canonical dictionary of coachable skills.
- `linguistic_feature_aliases`: Maps raw AI model labels to canonical features.
- `analysis_findings`: An immutable event log for every suggestion shown to the learner.
- `user_feature_profiles`: Aggregated mastery stats per learner and feature.

## ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Philosophy

- **Invisible Assessment**: Users never feel like they are being tested.
- **Confidence Celebration**: Progress is celebrated in practical, encouraging terms.
- **Quality Over Speed**: Fluency analysis focuses on communication effectiveness, not words per minute.
