# Documentation Naming Convention

To keep the documentation organized and easy to navigate, all files in this directory should follow a consistent naming convention.

## Filename Format

All filenames should follow the format: `category-topic.md`

*   **`category`**: A prefix that identifies the type of document.
*   **`topic`**: A short, descriptive name for the document content, using kebab-case (all lowercase with hyphens).
