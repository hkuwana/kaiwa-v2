# Kaiwa Ideal Customer Profiles (ICP)

> **Core Philosophy**: Kaiwa customers are not "language learners" in the traditional sense. They are **High-Stakes Connectors**—people whose relationships depend on real, emotional conversations in another language. Their motivation is driven by **fear and love**, not gamification or test scores.

## Persona 1: "The Committed Partner" (Sofia)

### Background

Sofia (29, Product Designer, American) has been dating Yuto (Japanese) for two years. They live together in New York. She has basic Japanese proficiency (B1/N4) but has never had a deep, emotional conversation in his language. She uses various apps (Duolingo, Babbel) but they feel disconnected from her real life.

### The "Job-to-be-Done" (Ticking Clock)

Yuto has invited her to Tokyo to meet his parents for the first time. This is no longer a "nice-to-have"; it's a **life-changing event**.

### Core Fears (The Noise in Her Head)

- "What if his parents think I'm rude or stupid?"
- "My textbook taught me 'This is a pen.' It didn't teach me how to say, 'Thank you for having me, your son is the most important person in my life.'"
- "What if his father asks me about our future and I freeze?"
- "I don't care about passing a test. I care about his mom liking me."

### The "Signal" She's Desperate For

- "How to impress Japanese parents"
- "Practice meeting the in-laws in Japanese"
- "What to say when meeting boyfriend's Japanese family"
- "Polite Japanese for high-stakes situations"

### Why Kaiwa is Her Only Solution

1. **Survival Training Ground**: Not a classroom; a flight simulator for one specific weekend
2. **Specific Scenarios**: She can immediately find and practice "Meeting the Family," "Expressing Gratitude," "Apologizing"
3. **Real-World Bridge**: Prep Plan + Warm-Up features are built exactly for her
4. **Connection > Correctness**: AI coach helps her sound sincere, not just grammatically perfect

### Lifetime Arc (Multi-Year Engagement)

- **Year 1-2**: "Meet the parents without embarrassing myself"
  - Frequency: 3-4x/month (leading up to visit)
  - Pain: "What if I sound stupid?"

- **Year 2-3**: "Have real emotional conversations with Yuto"
  - Frequency: 2-3x/month (maintenance)
  - Pain: "I can't express my depth in his language"

- **Year 3-4**: "Can I actually live in Japan?"
  - Frequency: Weekly
  - Pain: "Can I handle the speed and nuance of daily life?"

- **Year 4-5**: "I'm pregnant—how do I parent in two languages?"
  - Frequency: 2-3x/week
  - Pain: "I'm responsible for my child's fluency too"

- **Year 5+**: "I work here now—office politics in Japanese"
  - Frequency: 2-3x/month
  - Pain: "I need to sound competent, not just polite"

### Churn Risk & Retention Lever

**Risk**: After meeting the parents, she may feel "fixed" and drop off for 3-6 months.
**Lever**: Position Kaiwa as "relationship maintenance tool." "The next milestone is living together/engagement/moving abroad. What conversations do you need to prepare for?"

### Pricing Sensitivity

**Moderate-to-High**: She's emotionally invested in the relationship. Willing to pay $19-29/mo for a tool that directly impacts her life partner relationship.

### Messaging Angle

_"You've got grammar down. Now let's make sure he knows you love him."_

## Persona 2: "The Returning Expat" (David)

### Background

David (35, Engineer) grew up in California. His parents are from Mexico, but they only spoke English at home so he would "fit in." He can understand spoken Spanish but can't produce it. He feels deep shame and disconnection from his roots.

### The "Job-to-be-Done" (Ticking Clock)

He's attending a family reunion (wedding, funeral, or just reconnecting with aunts/uncles/cousins) in Mexico City. He hasn't spoken to them in years.

### Core Fears (The Noise in His Head)

- "I feel like a fraud. I look the part, I have the name, but I can't talk to my abuela."
- "They'll talk to me in Spanish, and I'll have to reply in English like an idiot."
- "I want to share a memory with my grandfather, but I don't have the emotional vocabulary."
- "I'm afraid I'll just sit there silently, and they'll judge me."

### The "Signal" He's Desperate For

- "How to reconnect with family in Spanish"
- "Practice emotional Spanish conversations"
- "Overcoming fear of speaking Spanish"
- "Family reunion Spanish" | "Heritage language reconnection"

### Why Kaiwa is His Only Solution

1. **Emotional Vocabulary**: He doesn't need "el gato." He needs to apologize (for his bad Spanish), express grief, share memories, ask for forgiveness
2. **Relational Repair**: Kaiwa acknowledges his job-to-be-done is _relational_, not grammatical
3. **Safety Space**: He can practice without judgment before facing his family

### Lifetime Arc (Cyclical Engagement)

- **Year 1**: "Family reunion reconnection"
  - Frequency: 3-4x/week (4-week intensive prep)
  - Pain: "I'm ashamed of my Spanish"

- **Year 1-2**: "Maintaining relationship with abuela"
  - Frequency: 1-2x/month (weekly calls with family)
  - Pain: "I don't have things to talk about"

- **Year 2-3**: "Teaching my kids about their culture"
  - Frequency: 2-3x/month (if he has kids)
  - Pain: "I don't know how to pass this down"

- **Year 3+**: "Cycles of reconnection"
  - Frequency: 1-2x/month (ongoing family maintenance)
  - Pain: "Deepening cultural identity"

### Churn Risk & Retention Lever

**Risk**: High churn after the event if positioned as "reunion prep." He might feel "done."
**Lever**: Reposition as "ongoing family relationship maintenance." "The reunion was the start. Now let's keep that connection alive."

### Pricing Sensitivity

**Moderate**: Emotional investment is high, but income/career may be primary. Willing to pay if it solves the shame problem.

### Messaging Angle

_"You're not starting from zero. You just need permission to sound like yourself again."_

## Persona 3: "The Relocation Expat" (Jamie)

### Background

Jamie (32, Marketing Manager) just accepted a job in Berlin and is relocating from the US for 3-5 years. Their German is A2/B1—enough for work meetings and basics, but not for making friends or navigating daily life with confidence.

### The "Job-to-be-Done" (Ticking Clock)

They arrive in Berlin in 6 weeks. They know no one. They want to build a life there, not just survive work.

### Core Fears

- "Will I ever make real friends here, or will I always be the American?"
- "Work meetings are one thing, but what if someone invites me out and I can't keep up?"
- "Dating in another language seems impossible."
- "I'm starting over—I need to not feel like an outsider for 3+ years."

### The "Signal" They're Searching For

- "How to make friends in Berlin in German"
- "Practice casual conversations in German"
- "German for expat daily life"
- "Dating in German" | "Small talk at work events"

### Why Kaiwa is Their Solution

1. **Daily Life, Not Textbooks**: They need scenarios for work drinks, dates, neighbor conversations, not grammar rules
2. **Gradual Progression**: As they settle in (months 1-12), they can level up from "ordering coffee" to "deeper friendships"
3. **Maintenance Mode**: Even after 2 years, they use it for specific scenarios (e.g., "how to tell my boss bad news")

### Lifetime Arc (Long-Term Engagement)

- **Month 1-3**: "Survival & orientation"
  - Frequency: 3-4x/week
  - Scenarios: ordering, asking directions, work basics

- **Month 3-12**: "Building a social life"
  - Frequency: 2-3x/week
  - Scenarios: making friends, dating, small talk

- **Year 1-3**: "Deep integration"
  - Frequency: 1-2x/week (maintenance + specific needs)
  - Scenarios: career advancement, relationship milestones

- **Year 3+**: "Mastery & mentoring"
  - Frequency: 1x/month or on-demand
  - Scenarios: helping newcomers, advanced professional conversations

### Churn Risk & Retention Lever

**Risk**: After 18 months, they may feel confident enough to drop off.
**Lever**: "You're fluent enough to get by. Ready to actually _belong_?" Introduce community features (practice with other expats, group scenarios).

### Pricing Sensitivity

**High**: They're in a high-income career, relocating for a job. Willing to pay $25-40/mo for 3 years to build a life in a new country.

### Messaging Angle

_"You know the rules of the language. Now let's help you understand the soul of the culture."_

## Persona 4: "The Permanent Immigrant" (Rosa)

### Background

Rosa (28, Nurse) moved permanently to Canada from the Philippines 2 years ago. She has a work visa sponsorship and is on the path to permanent residency. She speaks English at work, but fluency is still challenging—especially medical/professional English with proper register and nuance.

### The "Job-to-be-Done" (Ticking Clock)

She wants to advance to a senior nursing role. She needs to pass professional exams (NCLEX-RN, IELTS for PR), and she wants to build a social life outside of work.

### Core Fears

- "Will I ever sound natural, or will I always have an accent?"
- "I'm worried I'll make a clinical mistake because I didn't understand something quickly enough."
- "Will I ever belong here, or am I always going to be the foreign nurse?"
- "Dating/socializing is hard when people comment on my English constantly."

### The "Signal" They're Searching For

- "Professional English for healthcare"
- "Passing IELTS/NCLEX in English"
- "Medical terminology confidence"
- "English for building friendships in Canada"

### Why Kaiwa is Their Solution

1. **Professional + Personal**: Scenarios cover both work (patient conversations, team discussions) and life (making friends, dating, handling discrimination)
2. **Exam-Aligned**: Practice real scenarios that appear in professional exams
3. **Belonging**: Long-term engagement tied to her immigration journey (2-5+ years)

### Lifetime Arc (5-10+ Year Engagement)

- **Year 1-2**: "Passing exams + initial confidence"
  - Frequency: 3-4x/week
  - Scenarios: medical exams, professional conversations

- **Year 2-3**: "Career advancement"
  - Frequency: 2x/week
  - Scenarios: leading teams, difficult patient conversations

- **Year 3-5**: "Building social life"
  - Frequency: 1-2x/week
  - Scenarios: friendships, dating, navigating cultural differences

- **Year 5+**: "Mastery & mentoring"
  - Frequency: 1x/month or on-demand
  - Scenarios: helping new immigrants, professional excellence

### Churn Risk & Retention Lever

**Risk**: May churn after passing exams if positioned only as "exam prep."
**Lever**: "You passed the test. Now pass the belonging test." Emphasize long-term integration and social fluency.

### Pricing Sensitivity

**Moderate**: Earning in Canadian healthcare, supporting family in Philippines. Willing to pay $15-25/mo if it directly impacts career advancement and permanent residency approval.

### Messaging Angle

_"You're qualified. You belong. Let's make sure they know it."_

## Who Your ICP is NOT (The "Noise" to Ignore)

### The "Duolingo Grinder"

- Loves streaks, points, leaderboards
- Will churn when Kaiwa feels hard and there are no badges
- **Action**: Do not build for them

### The "Test Taker"

- Just needs to pass AP Spanish, JLPT N2, or similar exam
- Values grammar drills and vocab lists
- Will find Kaiwa "inefficient"
- **Action**: Acknowledge (referral to test-prep tools), but don't prioritize

### The "Casual Tourist"

- Just needs to order coffee and find the bathroom
- Stakes are too low
- Will be overwhelmed by emotional depth
- **Action**: Polite redirect; not your audience

### The "Business Professional" (Future Vertical, Not Core ICP)

- Needs to negotiate contracts or give presentations
- Motivation is transactional, not relational
- This is a potential future vertical but distracts from "love" and "fear" signal
- **Action**: Reserve for Phase 2; focus on relational ICPs now

### Monthly Commitment Tier ($19/mo)

- **Money-back guarantee**: Complete 8 sessions/month → get $5 credit back

| ------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
