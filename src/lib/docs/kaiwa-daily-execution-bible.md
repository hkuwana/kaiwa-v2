## YOUR DAILY 12-HOUR ROUTINE: 3-Hour Builder Blocks (Flexible for Calls)

**Philosophy**: Based on Paul Graham's "Manager vs Builder"—you're a builder, not a manager. You need 3-hour uninterrupted blocks to do deep work. But you also need flexibility for calls across US & Japan timezones. So each block has a primary purpose + built-in call flexibility.

---

### **MORNING ROUTINE (6:45am - 8:45am)**

**6:45-7:15am: Wake Up Ritual**
- Wake up at 6:45am (your natural time)
- Drink water, stretch, take a breath
- Review yesterday's evening plan or morning's schedule
- No phone, no journal, just get your head clear
- Think about what you're excited about today

**7:15-8:15am: Exercise (Non-negotiable, 1 Hour)**
- 1 hour walk, run, yoga, strength training, or whatever gets you moving
- NO phone during this time. Seriously.
- Use this to think through the day ahead, decompress, build energy
- This is your anchor for doing 12 hours/day without burning out

**8:15-8:45am: Shower + Breakfast + Schedule Decision**
- 20 min shower + get ready
- 10 min breakfast + strong coffee
- Eat something real (not just coffee)
- **Decide your 3-hour blocks for today** (see template below)

---

### **YOUR DAILY SCHEDULE: Three 3-Hour Builder Blocks**

**What's a "3-Hour Builder Block"?**
- You choose ONE primary task for each block (Building, Outreach, Iteration, Observation)
- You have 3 hours of mostly uninterrupted time
- There's a 30-min "call window" during each block (9:45-10:15am, 2:30-3:00pm, 5:30-6:00pm)
- If no calls come in, you use those 30 min as a break/snack and keep working on your block
- If a call does come in, you take it without guilt—it's built-in

---

### **BLOCK 1: 8:45am - 11:45am (3 Hours)**

**Morning Decision:**
What is Block 1 today? Choose ONE:
- [ ] **BUILDING**: Code, product design, new features (CTA, outcome tracking, new scenarios, UI)
- [ ] **OUTREACH**: Emails to the 40, Reddit/Twitter posts, warm lead follow-ups, calendar invites
- [ ] **ITERATION**: Fix things based on yesterday's observations (product tweaks, copy, timing)
- [ ] **OBSERVATION**: Watch free users, watch paid users, collect feedback, run user calls

**Your Block 1 Primary Task**: _______________

**8:45-9:45am**: Deep work on your primary task
- No Slack, no email, no distractions
- Just you and the task
- At 9:15am: Quick water/stretch break (2 min)

**9:45-10:15am**: Call Window
- Are you scheduled for a call? Take it.
- No call? Use it as a proper break. Coffee, walk, snack. Come back fresh.
- Check: Any urgent messages? (30 sec glance, don't respond)

**10:15-11:45am**: Continue deep work
- Same focus as first 90 min
- At 10:45am: 2-min stretch break if needed
- This block ends at 11:45am

**At 11:45am**: Log what you did
- How much progress on your primary task?
- Did you hit your target for this block? (e.g., "Built CTA prompt and button")
- Any blockers?

---

### **LUNCH & RESET (11:45am - 1:00pm)**

**11:45am-12:45pm: Actual Lunch**
- Eat real food away from desk
- 15-min walk outside (no phone)

**12:45-1:00pm: Block 2 Decision**
- What's Block 2 today? (Choose from Building, Outreach, Iteration, Observation)
- Your Block 2 Primary Task: _______________
- Any prep needed? (Have links ready, open files, etc.)

---

### **BLOCK 2: 1:00pm - 4:00pm (3 Hours)**

**Same structure as Block 1:**

**1:00-2:00pm**: Deep work on Block 2 primary task

- Snack, walk, or just chill
- Genuinely disconnect from work

**4:15-4:30pm: Block 3 Decision**
- What's Block 3 today? (Choose from Building, Outreach, Iteration, Observation)
- Your Block 3 Primary Task: _______________

---

### **BLOCK 3: 4:30pm - 7:30pm (3 Hours)**

**Same structure as Blocks 1 & 2:**

**4:30-5:30pm**: Deep work on Block 3 primary task
- At 5:00pm: 2-min stretch break if needed

**5:30-6:00pm**: Call Window

---

### **EVENING ROUTINE (7:30pm - 9:30pm)**

**7:30-8:15pm: Dinner + Rest**
- Eat real food
- Phone on silent
- Watch something, read, chill
- Genuinely disconnect from work

**8:15-9:15pm: Optional Content/Calls**
- Could be: Writing outcome story, running an extra call, research
- OR: Just more rest if you're burned out

**9:15-9:30pm: Night Planning + Reflection Journal**
- **Quick evening journal** (15 min):
  - What went well today? (3 quick wins)
  - What didn't work? Why?
  - Did you hit your DMS?
  - One Sofia insight
  - Energy level (1-10)
  - **Tomorrow's Block Plan**: What are your 3 blocks tomorrow?
    - Block 1: [Building/Outreach/Iteration/Observation]
    - Block 2: [Building/Outreach/Iteration/Observation]
    - Block 3: [Building/Outreach/Iteration/Observation]

---

### **HOW TO PLAN YOUR BLOCKS (Night Before or Morning)**

**Option 1: Night Before (Recommended)**
- At 9:15pm in your evening journal, write: "Tomorrow's Block Plan"
- Example:
  ```
  Tomorrow (Day 3):
  - Block 1 (8:45-11:45am): BUILDING upgrade CTA
  - Block 2 (1:00-4:00pm): OUTREACH + re-engagement (email 10 of the 40)
  - Block 3 (4:30-7:30pm): ITERATION + observation (watch free users, fix friction)
  ```
- This way you wake up knowing exactly what you're doing all day

**Option 2: Morning (6:45-8:45am)**
- During shower/breakfast/setup, decide your 3 blocks based on:
  - What's the #1 priority today? Put it in Block 1 (freshest energy)
  - What needs to happen before we re-engage the 40? Build that
  - What observations do we need to make? Observe that
- Write it down during your 8:15-8:45am "Schedule Decision" time

---

### **EXAMPLE WEEK 1 BLOCK PLAN**

**Day 1:**
- Block 1: BUILDING (metrics setup + CTA design)
- Block 2: BUILDING (CTA code)
- Block 3: OBSERVATION (watch 3 users, identify friction)

**Day 2:**
- Block 1: BUILDING (finish CTA, deploy)
- Block 2: OBSERVATION (did CTA work? watch clicks)
- Block 3: ITERATION (fix CTA based on feedback)

**Day 3:**
- Block 1: BUILDING (outcome tracking code)
- Block 2: OBSERVATION (test outcome tracking with users)
- Block 3: ITERATION (fix based on feedback)

**Day 4:**
- Block 1: BUILDING (finish & deploy outcome tracking)
- Block 2: OUTREACH (email 5-7 of the 40)
- Block 3: OBSERVATION (watch responses, monitor re-activation)

**Day 5:**
- Block 1: OUTREACH (email rest of the 40)
- Block 2: OBSERVATION (track re-engagement, conversions, clicks)
- Block 3: ITERATION (fix top friction point from observations)

**Day 6-7:**
- Continue cycle: OUTREACH → OBSERVATION → ITERATION based on DMS score

---

### **FLEXIBILITY WITH TIMEZONES (US & Japan Calls)**

**Japan Daytime Calls (9am-5pm JST):**
- Slot people into your call windows naturally
- 9:45-10:15am, 2:30-3:00pm, 5:30-6:00pm
- Or schedule longer calls that replace one of the windows (20-30 min call = 30-min window)

**US Evening Calls (7pm-10pm PT = 11am-2am JST):**
- These might not fit your morning/afternoon
- Options:
  - Do them during Block 3's call window (5:30-6:00pm JST = 1:00-1:30am PT) — probably too late
  - OR: Schedule for evening after 8:00pm JST (4:00-7:00am PT) — early for them, late for you
  - OR: Have a "call buffer day" 1x/week where Block 3 is specifically for US calls

**Timezone Strategy for Week 2+:**
- When you reach out to new users, ask: "What timezone are you in? When's good?"
- Japan people: Book 9:45-10:15am or 2:30-3:00pm
- US people: Book evening or suggest next morning
- Have one "US call day" per week where you schedule 3-4 calls back-to-back

---

### **EVENING ROUTINE (6:00pm - 9:00pm)**

**6:00-7:00pm: Dinner + Complete Rest**
- Eat real food
- Phone on silent
- Watch something, read, chill
- Genuinely disconn from work

**7:00-8:30pm: Content or Calls (if applicable)**
- This is optional depending on week
- Could be: Writing outcome story, running a user call, research
- OR: Just more rest if you're burned out

**8:30-9:15pm: Evening Reflection Journal (THE ONLY JOURNAL TIME)**
- **Reflection (30-45 min - write by hand)**:
  - This is your ONE time to collect all your thoughts for the day
  - What went well today? (even tiny wins count)
  - What didn't work? Why?
  - Did you hit your Daily Momentum Score?
  - One insight: What did you learn about Sofia today?
  - How's your energy? (1-10) Can you sustain this tomorrow?
  - What's your 1 priority for tomorrow?
  - Any fears, wins, random thoughts?

  Example:
  ```
  8:30pm Journal:

  Good: Deployed CTA, 3 people clicked immediately. Energy was high all day.
  Bad: Copy was confusing, people thought "full memory" meant AI reading minds lol.
  DMS Hit: Yes! 100/100 (conversation + observation + shipped).
  Insight: Sofia cares about "never saying the same thing twice" — she hates repetition.
  Energy: 8/10. Ready to go again tomorrow. Might rest Saturday.
  Tomorrow's priority: Rewrite CTA copy based on today's learning. Target: 80% click rate.
  Random: This exercise thing is helping. Morning run cleared my head. Feeling less anxious.
  ```

**9:15-9:30pm: Sleep Prep**
- Put phone in another room
- Set alarm for 6:00am
- Go to bed by 9:30pm (yes, you need sleep)

---

## YOUR ONE KPI: Daily Momentum Score (DMS)

This is the single metric you track every day. It tells you if you're moving forward or stalling.

**Daily Momentum Score = How many of these 3 things happened today?**

```
[ ] 1 REAL CONVERSATION: Did you talk to 1 human (call, email with response, user feedback)?
[ ] 1 OBSERVATION LOGGED: Did you watch someone use Kaiwa or read feedback and write it down?
[ ] 1 THING SHIPPED: Did you deploy a code change, new email copy, new scenario, or UI tweak?

DMS = (Number of ✓ out of 3) × 33
```

**Examples:**
- All 3 done = 100/100 DMS ✓
- 2 done = 67/100 DMS (still good, keep pushing)
- 1 done = 33/100 DMS (warning sign, why?)
- 0 done = 0/100 DMS (red flag, figure it out tomorrow)

**Track it daily:**
```
Week 1 DMS Log:
- Day 1: 100/100 (conversation + observation + shipped CTA copy)
- Day 2: 100/100 (conversation + observation + shipped CTA timing)
- Day 3: 67/100 (conversation + shipped, but no observation)
- Day 4: 100/100 (back on track)
- Day 5: 100/100
- Day 6: 100/100
- Day 7: 100/100
Week 1 Average: 95/100
```

**The rule:**
- If your weekly average DMS is >80, you're winning
- If it drops below 70, something's wrong (too tired? product issue? wrong outreach channels?)
- If it's 50 or lower for 2 days straight, stop and reassess

---

### **Why This KPI Works:**

1. **It's simple**: 3 things. Did you do them? Yes or no.
2. **It's actionable**: If DMS is low, you know exactly which block was missing
3. **It's motivating**: Seeing 100/100 feels real and concrete (not a vanity metric)
4. **It's predictive**: High DMS = high MRR in 2-3 weeks. Low DMS = low MRR. Direct correlation.

## WEEK 1: CRITICAL PATH (Build + Deploy)

### The Only Thing That Matters This Week:
1. **Day 1-2**: Build upgrade CTA (after free user completes 3 sessions or after 1 week → show: "Unlock unlimited feedback, longer sessions, full memory")
2. **Day 3-4**: Build outcome tracking (After each session: "Next, try this conversation with [partner/family]. How'd it go?")
3. **Day 5**: Deploy both to production
4. **Day 6-7**: Send re-engagement email to 40 Sofias

**Daily 12-Hour Structure (Week 1):**

**8:00-9:00am**: Metrics review
- Check current conversion funnel: How many free users? When do they churn? (Establish baseline)
- Set up tracking: Free signups, free-to-paid conversion rate, retention by day

**9:00-11:30am**: Build upgrade CTA
- Design the upgrade prompt (what does it look like? when does it show?)
- Copy: What does Sofia need to hear to upgrade? ("More feedback = better results" or "Practice more = get comfortable faster")
- Build & deploy

**11:30am-1:00pm**: Lunch + walk

**1:00-3:00pm**: Build outcome tracking
- Add post-session prompt: "Next, practice [specific scenario] with [person]. Tell us how it went."
- Design follow-up email: "How did the conversation go? Here's what we learned from others..."
- Build & deploy

**3:00-4:00pm**: Outreach to the 40
- Email 5-7 of the 40: "Hey, we shipped [upgrade CTA + outcome tracking]. Can you try again? We're tracking if it actually helps."
- Track who responds, who opens email, who tries again

**4:00-5:00pm**: Observation (current free users)
- Watch 2-3 free users interact with new upgrade CTA
- Do they understand it? Do they click? Do they resist?
- Take detailed notes: What's the friction?

**5:00-6:00pm**: Dinner + rest

**6:00-8:00pm**: Ship based on observation
- Fix the upgrade CTA based on what you saw (if nobody clicked, why? Is copy unclear? Is timing wrong? Is offer weak?)
- Iterate and re-deploy

**8:00-9:00pm**: Analysis + tomorrow planning
- How many people saw the upgrade CTA today?
- How many clicked?
- What's the conversion rate right now?
- What's the #1 fix for tomorrow?

---

## WEEK 2 ONWARD: Standard 12-Hour Daily Rhythm

**8:00-9:00am: Metrics & Momentum Check**
- Check overnight: Re-engagement email opens, clicks, signups, conversion
- Review: Free-to-paid conversion rate, retention by cohort
- Update tracker with yesterday's real outcomes

**9:00-10:30am: Outreach Round 1**
- Email 5-10 of the 40 (rotating through full list, re-engaging continuously)
- Message: "We shipped X based on your feedback. Can you try again? I'm tracking real conversations now."
- Monitor opens, clicks, replies

**10:30am-12:00pm: Shipping/Building**
- Fix #1 thing from yesterday's observations (conversion friction, product issues, outcome tracking, etc.)
- Deploy it live
- Tell 3 people: "We shipped [thing] because [reason]"

**12:00-1:00pm: Lunch + walk**

**1:00-2:30pm: Observation**
- Watch 3-4 free users interact with Kaiwa (especially post-upgrade CTA)
- Watch 2-3 paid users (do they use outcome tracking? Are they having real conversations?)
- Log: What confused them? What excited them? What made them upgrade?

**2:30-4:00pm: Shipping/Building Round 2**
- Fix #2 thing from observations (could be product, could be email copy, could be onboarding)
- Deploy
- Test with 1 user

**4:00-5:00pm: Outreach Round 2**
- Re-engage different set of 40 (5-10 people)
- Cold messages to new leads (Reddit, Twitter, Facebook groups)
- Calendar invites for calls

**5:00-6:00pm: Dinner + rest**

**6:00-7:30pm: Outreach/Calls**
- Confirm calls for later this week
- Run 1 user call if someone's available (20-30 min)
- Watch them use Kaiwa, ask: "Did you try that conversation? How'd it go?"

**7:30-9:00pm: Content + Strategy**
- Write 1 outcome story: "Sofia practiced asking her partner. Here's what happened."
- Post on Twitter/LinkedIn/blog
- Research one expansion channel (B2B2C, heritage speakers, etc.) for later

**9:00-9:30pm: Planning tomorrow**
- What's the #1 conversion blocker to fix tomorrow?
- Who are the next 10 to re-engage?
- Are we tracking toward $500-1k MRR by end of month?

---

## Real Outcomes Tracking (The Most Important Part)

Every single day, document:
- **Reactivations**: How many of the 40 did you reach? How many tried again?
- **Conversions**: How many free users upgraded? Why did they upgrade?
- **Retention**: Are they coming back? Are they having real conversations?
- **Real Outcomes**: Did they practice a conversation they're afraid of? Did it go better?

Example daily log:
```
Day 15 (Friday):
- Re-engaged: 8 of the 40 (sent emails to Sofia #23, #15, #8, etc.)
- Email open rate: 5/8 (62.5%)
- Reactivations: 2 people re-tried the app
- Free-to-paid conversions: 1 person upgraded to Plus
- Real outcome captured: "Sofia practiced talking to her partner about Japanese. Partner agreed to help her practice more. Sofia coming back tomorrow."
- Conversion funnel: 45 users saw upgrade CTA, 3 clicked, 1 upgraded = 2.2% CTA click-through, 33% conversion
- #1 fix for tomorrow: Upgrade CTA copy is unclear. People aren't understanding what "full memory" means. Rewrite to: "Never repeat yourself—Kaiwa remembers every conversation."
```

---

## Month 1 Targets (30 Days)

These are the metrics that matter:

**Week 1 (Days 1-7):**
- Deploy upgrade CTA + outcome tracking (DONE by Day 5)
- Send re-engagement email to all 40 (DONE by Day 7)
- Establish baseline: Current conversion rate, churn rate, real outcome rate

**Week 2 (Days 8-14):**
- Re-engage at least 20 of the 40 (50% reactivation)
- Hit 3-5 free-to-paid conversions ($60-150 MRR)
- Capture 5-10 real outcomes (people actually having conversations)
- Conversion funnel target: >5% upgrade CTA click-through, >20% conversion rate

**Week 3 (Days 15-21):**
- Re-engage 30 of the 40 (75% reactivation)
- Hit 8-12 total conversions ($160-360 MRR)
- Capture 15-20 real outcomes
- Conversion funnel improving: >8% CTA click-through, >25% conversion

**Week 4 (Days 22-30):**
- Re-engage 35+ of the 40 (nearly all)
- Hit 15-20 total new conversions ($300-600 MRR)
- Current MRR target: $500-1k from re-engagement + new users
- Capture 25-30 real outcomes
- Conversion funnel: >10% CTA click-through, >30% conversion, >40% retention by day 7

**End of Month 1 Target: $500-1k MRR**

---

## Decision Points (When to Pivot)

**If by Day 14 you're not at $150+ MRR:**
- The upgrade CTA isn't working (redesign copy/timing/offer)
- The product isn't actually solving the pain (pivot to different persona or outcome)
- The 40 don't actually care (you need NEW outreach channels, not re-engagement)

**If by Day 30 you hit $500+ MRR:**
- Keep doing exactly this (scaling the funnel)
- Begin Phase 2 research (heritage speakers, ESL workers, professionals)

**If by Day 30 you hit $1k+ MRR:**
- You have venture proof
- Start planning B2B2C approach
- Begin documenting case studies for investor pitch

## 🚨 **Non-Negotiable Rules**

1. **Talk to 1 human per day, minimum** — Even if it's just a 10-min DM conversation
2. **Watch them use Kaiwa** — You need to see confusion in real time
3. **Ship something based on what you learned** — Even tiny fixes count
4. **No planning without doing** — The docs are dead; execution is alive
5. **Sofia only** — Every outreach is either TO a Sofia or ABOUT finding a Sofia
6. **No multi-tasking** — When you're on a call, you're ALL in. No email, no Slack.
7. **Log every conversation** — Even if it's 2 lines, log it. Patterns matter.

---

## 🗑️ **Archive These Docs** (You Don't Need Them Anymore)

Delete or archive to a folder:
- strategy-marketing.md (the long version)
- solo-founder-action-plan.md (too complex for right now)
- feedback-growth-4-week-plan.md (consolidated into this doc)
- daily-content-creation-guide.md (you're doing Thursday's blog only)
- content-calendar-2025.md (too much planning, not enough doing)
- friend-outreach-playbook.md (covered in Tuesday's section)

**Keep these:**
- icp-personas.md (reference Sofia when confused)
- strategy-quick-start-founder-emails.md (for Day 1 founder email setup)

---

## 📌 **The TL;DR**

**Every single day:**
1. Talk to 1 person (30 min) → Reach out via Reddit/Email/Text/Meetup
2. Watch them use Kaiwa (30 min) → Ask 3 critical questions
3. Ship 1 thing (60 min) → Based on what you learned

**Every week has ONE theme:**
- Monday: Schedule + Reddit
- Tuesday: Friend calls
- Wednesday: Email warmups
- Thursday: Content (blog)
- Friday: Warm leads + planning
- Saturday: Community (Practice Lab)
- Sunday: Review + ship

**That's it.** Everything else is noise.
