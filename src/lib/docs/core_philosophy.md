Our philosophy is built on a **single, user-centric promise**: create a state of **effortless immersion**. We achieve this by investing heavily in a complex, anticipatory backend to power a radically simple frontend.

🎯 **The user should feel the benefit of our logic without ever seeing the machinery.**

## 🌊 Principle I: Effortless Immersion

> **User Goal**: Learn a language by speaking it  
> **Our Goal**: Make the technology disappear

### 🎯 What This Means

- ❌ **Eliminate** every non-essential UI element
- 🔕 **Remove** distracting notifications
- 🤔 **Minimize** decision points that break conversational flow
- 🏠 **Create** a space dedicated to dialogue, not an "app"

### ✨ The Result

The interface should feel **less like an app and more like a space dedicated to dialogue**.

## 🧠 Principle II: Anticipatory Intelligence

> **Core Insight**: Our backend is our greatest design tool. It must be complex so the frontend can be simple.

### 🔍 What Our Backend Does

| Function                | Purpose                      | User Experience             |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 📊 **Analyze Context**  | Understand conversation flow | Natural dialogue adaptation |
| 📈 **Track Progress**   | Monitor learning patterns    | Personalized difficulty     |
| 🔮 **Anticipate Needs** | Predict user struggles       | Proactive support           |

### 🎭 How Intelligence Manifests

- ✨ **Subtle AI behavior adaptations** (not UI widgets)
- 🤗 **Natural, supportive responses** (not explicit help prompts)
- 💫 **Invisible assistance** (user never has to ask for help)

**The system adapts to struggle or success in ways that feel natural and supportive.**

## ✨ Principle III: Radical Simplicity

> **Design Metric**: Measured by features **removed**, not added.

### 📜 Our Design Priorities

| ✅ **Prioritize** | ❌ **Avoid** |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| 🔤 Typography     | 🔘 Buttons   |
| 🌌 Space          | 📋 Menus     |
| 🌊 Fluid motion   | 🖥️ Chrome    |

### 🎯 The Simplicity Test

**Every element on screen must answer**:

> "Why do I exist? What essential purpose do I serve?"

### ⚡ Success Metric

**The user should master the entire application within seconds, because the only skill required is conversation.**

## 🔍 Principle IV: Trust Through Transparency (of Intent)

> **Balance**: Logic is hidden, but **intent must be crystal clear**.

### 🎯 User Experience Goals

- 🎮 **User feels in control** at all times
- 🤔 **Purpose is understood** without explanation
- 🕰️ **Mechanism stays invisible** but intent is obvious

### 🌱 Perfect Example: BreathingCircle

When a user hesitates:

- 💚 **Calming pulse appears** (transparent support)
- ⏳ **Communicates patience** (clear intent)
- 💬 **No text needed** (invisible mechanism)

## 🏗️ Architectural Principles

### 1. 🎯 Domain-Driven Design (Not Technical Features)

> **Golden Rule**: Organize by **learning domains**, not technical capabilities.

#### ✅ **GOOD: Domain Boundaries**

```text
✅ GOOD: Domain boundaries
src/domains/
├── 🎯 learning/          # Core learning loop (THE KERNEL)
├── 🔐 identity/          # User & auth (OPTIONAL)
└── 🏗️ infrastructure/    # Technical adapters

❌ BAD: Technical feature boundaries
src/features/audio/    # This couples UI with technical concerns
```

### 2. ⚛️ Functional Core, Imperative Shell

> **Architecture Rule**: Pure business logic at the center, side effects at the edges.

#### ✅ **GOOD: Pure Functional Core**

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Pure functional core
const core = {
	// All business logic as pure functions
	nextState: (state: State, action: Action) => State,
	calculateScore: (expected: string, actual: string) => number
};

// Imperative shell (adapters only)
const shell = {
	audio: { record: () => Promise<ArrayBuffer> },
	ai: { complete: (prompt: string) => Promise<string> }
};

// ❌ BAD: Mixed concerns
class AudioService {
	state = { recording: false }; // Mutable state
	async record() {
		/* side effects mixed with logic */
	}
}
```

### 3. Single State Tree with Derived Values

**Rule**: One source of truth, derive everything else.

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Single state tree
type AppState = {
	conversation: ConversationState;
	user: UserState;
};

// Derive computed values
const isRecording = $derived(state.conversation.status === 'recording');
const progress = $derived(calculateProgress(state.conversation.history));

// ❌ BAD: Multiple stores with shared state
const audioStore = writable({ recording: false });
const conversationStore = writable({ messages: [] });
```

### 4. Orchestrator Pattern (Not Event Bus)

**Rule**: Use a central orchestrator for coordination, not distributed events.

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Orchestrator pattern
const orchestrator = {
 state: appState,
 dispatch: (action: Action) => {
  const newState = core.transition(state, action);
  const effects = core.effects(state, action);
  effects.forEach(shell.execute);
  state = newState;
 }
};

// ❌ BAD: Complex event chains
eventBus.on('audio.recorded', () =>
 eventBus.emit('transcription.start', ...));
```

## 🎯 The Kernel: Core Conversation Loop

The conversation kernel is the **single most important piece** of our application. Everything else exists to support this core loop.

### 🔄 Core Loop Structure

```typescript
// THE ENTIRE APP KERNEL - Start here!
type ConversationState = {
	status: 'idle' | 'recording' | 'processing' | 'speaking';
	sessionId: string;
	messages: Message[];
	startTime: number;
};

type Action =
	| { type: 'START_CONVERSATION' }
	| { type: 'START_RECORDING' }
	| { type: 'STOP_RECORDING'; audio: ArrayBuffer }
	| { type: 'RECEIVE_RESPONSE'; transcript: string; response: string }
	| { type: 'END_CONVERSATION' };
```

### 🎭 State Transitions

1. **Idle** → **Recording**: User starts speaking
2. **Recording** → **Processing**: User stops, AI processes
3. **Processing** → **Speaking**: AI responds
4. **Speaking** → **Idle**: Ready for next exchange

### 💫 Effects as Data

```typescript
// Side effects are data, not imperative calls
const effects = (state: ConversationState, action: Action): Effect[] => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case 'STOP_RECORDING':
			return [{ type: 'TRANSCRIBE', audio: action.audio }, { type: 'GENERATE_RESPONSE' }];
		case 'RECEIVE_RESPONSE':
			return [{ type: 'SPEAK', text: action.response }, { type: 'SAVE_EXCHANGE' }];
		default:
			return [];
	}
};
```

## 🎨 UI Design Principles

### 1. **Typography First**

- Use system fonts for performance
- Large, readable text sizes
- Generous line spacing for readability

### 2. **Space as Design Element**

- White space creates breathing room
- Group related elements with proximity
- Use margins to create visual hierarchy

### 3. **Motion with Purpose**

- Smooth transitions between states
- Loading states that feel natural
- Micro-interactions that provide feedback

### 4. **Color as Semantic Meaning**

- Primary colors for actions
- Neutral colors for content
- Semantic colors for feedback (success, error, warning)

## 🚀 Implementation Guidelines

### 1. **Start with the Kernel**

- Build the conversation loop first
- Test with mock data
- Ensure state transitions work perfectly

### 2. **Add Adapters Incrementally**

- Audio recording and playback
- AI integration
- User authentication
- Data persistence

### 3. **Polish the Experience**

- Smooth animations
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Accessibility features

### 4. **Measure and Iterate**

- User engagement metrics
- Performance benchmarks
- Accessibility compliance
- User feedback collection
