# Kaiwa Feedback & Growth — 4 Week Operating Plan

Purpose: stitch together the friend outreach playbook, founder email strategy, and marketing tactics into a repeatable operating rhythm for the next month.

---

## Week 0 Setup (Half Day Sprint)

- Spin up the **Feedback OS** spreadsheet with tabs for Master Tracker, Pattern Tracker, and Kanban.
- Duplicate the **Interview Doc Template** for the next 12 conversations and link each row in the tracker.
- Create three saved DM / email templates:
  - `Friend Invite` (personal text/DM based on the playbook)
  - `Warm Lead Follow-Up` (for founder email replies)
  - `Practice Lab Invite` (for community threads)
- Configure tooling:
  - Founder 3-day email sequence active in production with booking link verified.
  - Analytics events (open, click, booking, session start) shipping to PostHog.
  - Calendar blocks: `Research Ops Hour` (Mon) and `Narrative Hour` (Thu).

## Week 1 — Establish the Pipeline

**Feedback Ops**
- Populate tracker with at least 15 leads across segments (relationship navigator, family connector, solo learner).
- Tag each lead with acquisition source (friend DM, Reddit, founder email, Practice Lab).
- Stand up COUNTIF-based tag rollups so every note with `#friction` or `#value` increases the Pattern Tracker automatically.

**Outreach & Sessions**
- Schedule the first 4 friend calls; confirm screen share + narration expectations.
- Use the Five-Step call flow (context → baseline → walkthrough → dive → debrief) and capture the Three Critical Product Questions verbatim.
- After each session, log a one-line recap in the tracker and push action items into Kanban.

**Marketing & Narrative**
- Draft and post one “70% Campaign” story (LinkedIn/Twitter) that references a real call insight.
- Launch first Reddit thread in r/movingtojapan with a sincere founder story + invitation to Practice Lab.
- Draft 2 short-form video outlines (TikTok/Reels) highlighting “Love shouldn’t need subtitles” and “Midnight Test”.

**Community Flywheel**
- Announce the first Practice Lab (theme: “Meet the Parents rehearsal”) with incentive (free 1:1 follow-up).
- Send a two-bullet update to friends + VIP circle summarizing what shipped and what you’re testing next week.

---

## Week 2 — Accelerate Feedback Loops

**Feedback Ops**
- Review Pattern Tracker colors; identify first friction that’s hit 3 mentions and queue a `ship` task.
- Add `Next Touch Date` formula-driven reminders; ensure every participant has a future contact scheduled.

**Outreach & Sessions**
- Run 3 calls: 2 friends, 1 alpha stranger from Reddit/Discord. Use the same call flow and tag quotes with `#persona:<type>`.
- Experiment with a “Return Trigger” follow-up email 24 hours post-session (share one shipped tweak crediting them).

**Marketing & Narrative**
- Kick off the founder 3-day email sequence for the latest 10 signups and monitor replies; log top objections.
- Convert one friction insight into a “Before/After” LinkedIn carousel or Twitter thread.
- Publish a short blog or dev-notes recap titled “What 6 real conversations taught us this week”.

**Community Flywheel**
- Host Practice Lab #1, record highlight clips, and pull 2 quotes into the tracker as warm leads.
- Launch the `Community Stories` form and seed it with 2 example submissions.

---

## Week 3 — Expand Reach & Social Proof

**Feedback Ops**
- Audit tracker: confirm every participant has a status (e.g., `Active`, `Pending Follow-Up`, `Dormant`).
- Run COUNTIF on `#value` tags to surface breakthrough themes; prepare to showcase 2 as testimonials.

**Outreach & Sessions**
- Prioritize 1 paid alpha candidate (offer discount for feedback) and 2 existing participants for return sessions.
- Introduce a mini-survey before calls to capture stakes (relationship urgency vs. professional need).

**Marketing & Narrative**
- Launch the “Relationship Decay” narrative in a medium-length post (LinkedIn/Newsletter) that ends with Practice Lab invite.
- Post one “Build-in-public tweak” video showing a feature shipping in response to feedback.
- Run a community prompt: “What’s the hardest conversation you’ve had to navigate in Japanese?”; reply thoughtfully to every comment.

**Community Flywheel**
- Announce transparent AI usage guidelines (draft with AI, edit manually) and share across Reddit/Twitter.
- Convert highlight clips into a short montage for TikTok/Reels; include CTA to join next Lab or book a call.

## Week 4 — Layer in Viral Hooks & Prepare Scale

**Feedback Ops**
- Finalize a monthly retro: top 3 value moments, top 3 friction patterns, actions taken, outcomes.
- Evaluate Kanban throughput (ship/test/story) and decide which items graduate to roadmap vs. archive.

**Outreach & Sessions**
- Run 2 return sessions to validate changes + 1 new cold outreach call (community referral or founder email reply).
- Introduce incentives for referrals: offer “Practice Lab Priority + personalized study plan” for any friend they bring.

**Marketing & Narrative**
- Release “The Tokyo Test” v1 (Notion or Google Form) and plug it in founder email Day 2 + community posts.
- Share a “Wins & Fixes” public thread summarizing the month, linking to changelog and next month’s focus.
- Cross-post best performing content to LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, and newsletter; note channel metrics in tracker.

**Community Flywheel**
- Host an AMA featuring 2 alpha users; prep questions from earlier sessions and stream highlight quotes.
- Publish mini-case study (“How [Name] went from 30% to 80% understood at family dinner in 3 weeks”) using real call data.

## Friend Outreach Session Flow (Use Every Call)

1. **Set Context (3 min)** – Thank them, state you want friction, confirm narration and interruptions anytime.
2. **Baseline Snapshot (5 min)** – Capture current practice routine and stakes; log quotes with tags.
3. **Live Walkthrough (15 min)** – Observe silently unless blocked; note hesitation, skipped elements, CX pain.
4. **Deep Dive (5 min)** – Explore friction or surprises while fresh.
5. **Rapid Debrief (2 min)** – Ask:
   - Moment of value — “What felt genuinely useful?”
   - Point of friction — “Where did you feel confused or stuck?”
   - Return trigger — “What would bring you back tomorrow?”
   - Bonus: “What were you expecting that you didn’t see?”
6. **After the Session** – Send thank-you + one learning, log tracker recap, invite to feedback circle, and push action items to Kanban.

## Founder Email Engine (Runs Weekly)

- **Target**: Every new signup without a conversation in 72 hours.
- **Sequence**:
  - Day 1 (24h): Welcome + “just try one 3-minute conversation” CTA.
  - Day 2 (48h): Objection handling email (time, anxiety, confusion).
  - Day 3 (72h): Personal offer to talk with booking link.
- **Ops Notes**:
  - Send from `Hiro <hiro@trykaiwa.com>` with reply-to same address.
  - Track `founder_email_sent`, `founder_email_clicked`, `calendar_booking`, `email_conversion` in PostHog.
  - Reply to every response within 4 hours; log objections using inline tags (`#objection:time`, `#objection:confidence`).
  - When a user replies or books, add them to the tracker and schedule follow-up call in Tuesday/Saturday slots.

---

## Content & Campaign Recipes

- **Weekly Content Rhythm**:
  - `User Breakthrough` — share a verbatim quote tied to a solved friction.
  - `Build-in-Public Tweak` — show what shipped due to feedback (loom or screenshot).
  - `Community Prompt` — question that invites real stories (e.g., Midnight Test scenario).
- **Narrative Anchors** (cycle through):
  - “Love shouldn’t need subtitles” (relationship urgency).
  - “The 70% Campaign” (only a fraction of the real you is seen).
  - “Relationship Decay” (each mistranslation is a micro-betrayal).
  - “Grandparent Clock” (heritage urgency).
- **Channel Plays**:
  - Reddit: founder story → invite to Practice Lab + transparent roadmap.
  - LinkedIn/Twitter: thread summarizing real sessions; end with call to join community or book session.
  - TikTok/Reels: highlight clips from Practice Lab; overlay CTA “Want a dry run before meeting their parents?”
  - Email newsletter: weekly changelog formatted as “What we shipped / What we’re hearing / What’s next”.

Document performance each Sunday: impressions, saves, replies, DMs, conversions.

## Alpha User Acquisition & Word-of-Mouth

- **Positioning**: Frame alpha as “inner circle” helping save relationships from “slow death by Google Translate.” Offer perks: priority practice slots, custom study plan, shout-out in changelog.
- **Where to Advertise** (low-cost):
  - Founder emails (Day 3) → calendar link with “Alpha Access” wording.
  - Practice Lab announcements → include “Bring a friend and both get 2 extra sessions.”
  - Relevant subreddits/Discord servers → lead with story + explicit ask for alpha partners.
  - Personal network DM blitz every Friday (5 outreach messages).
- **Word-of-Mouth Flywheel**:
  - Immediately credit users in changelog and send them the snippet to share.
  - Provide sharable assets (quote card, short Loom) after each improvement tied to their feedback.
  - Implement “Referral Notes” column in tracker with reward status (e.g., `Pending gift`, `Reward sent`).
  - Ask in follow-up email: “Who else needs this conversation practice before [event]? Introduce us and I’ll prep a session for both of you.”
  - Celebrate community wins publicly (LinkedIn/Twitter shout-outs + VIP circle ping) to reinforce social proof.

**Paid ads**: Defer broad spend until funnels are dialed. Instead, test $50 micro-campaigns (retargeting or highly targeted keywords like “meet Japanese parents”) only if organic sources cannot fill 6 alpha slots/week.

## Metrics & Review Ritual

- **Weekly**: sessions run, new insights logged, action items shipped, founder email metrics, social engagement that led to DMs/bookings.
- **Monthly Retro (Week 4 Friday)**:
  - Top 3 value moments, top 3 friction issues, actions taken, outcomes observed.
  - Which campaigns drove alpha signups?
  - What do we double down on vs. drop next month?
- Archive all notes + changelog snapshots for compounding evidence when talking to users, investors, or community leaders.
