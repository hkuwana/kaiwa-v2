## Creative Experiments to Spark Early FOMO

- **Relationship Scenario Premieres**: Host a live, half-finished scenario walkthrough with commentary on what remains to build; let attendees vote on the next line or reaction so they feel ownership before it ships.
- **Love Letter Lab**: Offer short workshops where couples co-write bilingual voice notes; record the transformation and turn it into micro case studies and teaser clips.
- **“Fix My Conversation” Hotline**: Open a weekly Google Form where people submit an upcoming tricky dialogue; select one to prototype during Practice Lab and send them the draft script the same day.
- **Backstage Build Streams**: Twitch/YouTube mini-sprints narrating UX decisions (“Here’s why we reworked the apology flow”); drop Calendly link in chat for anyone who wants the finished version.
- **Alpha Circle Drops**: Release “relationship translator packs” (scripts, cultural notes, voice practice loops) exclusively to alpha members each Friday; encourage them to invite one couple to unlock the next pack.
- **Origin Story Interviews**: Record 10-minute conversations with bicultural couples or counselors about “the hardest conversation we ever had”; ship the highlights as community content and convert insights into new Kaiwa scenes.
- **Scenario Draft Club**: DM small communities and offer to build their unique scenario live if they bring five participants; gamify with a leaderboard of shipped scenes credited to each group.
- **Pocket Demo Moments**: Keep the mobile app or a lightweight prototype ready for spontaneous “show, don’t tell” demos in social settings; hand off the phone and narrate like a commentator instead of selling.

---

## In-Person Evangelism Without the Hard Sell

- **Set the Context Casually**: Share a quick anecdote (“A couple rehearsed meeting the parents in Kyoto last week and nailed it”) and pause—let curiosity pull the other person in before mentioning the product.
- **Use Permission Slips**: Ask, “Want to see the practice script they used?” rather than “Can I show you my app?”; framing it as sharing something helpful keeps their agency intact.
- **Let Them Drive**: If they say yes, hand over the device immediately with a single-step entry point (e.g., “Tap play and try the first line”). Stand beside them as a guide, not across as a seller.
- **Narrate Outcomes, Not Features**: While they interact, mention how another person used the same scenario to avoid a misunderstanding or impress the family—keep attention on results.
- **Invite Micro Commitments**: After the demo, offer an optional takeaway (“I can text you the script template if you want to tweak it for your situation”) instead of pushing for sign-up.
- **Plant Social Proof Seeds**: If at a gathering, mention others who tried it earlier (“Sara just ran through the apology script and tweaked it for her parents”) to spark organic interest.
- **Follow-Up as a Favor**: Message later with a quick “Here’s that script I mentioned” and a link to the Practice Lab—frame it as fulfilling their curiosity, not chasing a conversion.
- **Body Language Matters**: Stay relaxed, angle your body towards the screen with them, and keep statements exploratory (“Notice how the AI pauses to let you breathe”) so it feels collaborative.

## Reflection Questions to Keep the Cohort Engaged

Ask these at the end of the Sunday reset (and jot answers in the changelog):

- Who felt most seen or helped this week, and how can I amplify their story publicly?
- Which unfinished piece pulled people closer instead of pushing them away, and why?
- What did someone actually say (exact words) that proves the relationship wedge matters?
- Where did momentum drop, and what artifact (video, script, update) would reignite it?
- Which collaborator or alpha member surprised me, and how can I spotlight them next week?
- What promise did I make implicitly or explicitly; did I deliver or need to reframe it?
- If I announced a “relationship fluency summit” tomorrow, who are the first five invites and what’s the hook?

Use the answers to tweak next week’s content, Practice Lab theme, and referral prompts.

---

## Week 1 — Establish the Pipeline

**Feedback Ops**

- Populate tracker with at least 15 leads across segments (relationship navigator, family connector, solo learner).
- Tag each lead with acquisition source (friend DM, Reddit, founder email, Practice Lab).
- Stand up COUNTIF-based tag rollups so every note with `#friction` or `#value` increases the Pattern Tracker automatically.

**Outreach & Sessions**

- Schedule the first 4 friend calls; confirm screen share + narration expectations.
- Use the Five-Step call flow (context → baseline → walkthrough → dive → debrief) and capture the Three Critical Product Questions verbatim.
- After each session, log a one-line recap in the tracker and push action items into Kanban.

**Marketing & Narrative**

- Draft and post one “70% Campaign” story (LinkedIn/Twitter) that references a real call insight.
- Launch first Reddit thread in r/movingtojapan with a sincere founder story + invitation to Practice Lab.
- Draft 2 short-form video outlines (TikTok/Reels) highlighting “Love shouldn’t need subtitles” and “Midnight Test”.

**Community Flywheel**

- Announce the first Practice Lab (theme: “Meet the Parents rehearsal”) with incentive (free 1:1 follow-up).
- Send a two-bullet update to friends + VIP circle summarizing what shipped and what you’re testing next week.

---

## Week 2 — Accelerate Feedback Loops

**Feedback Ops**

- Review Pattern Tracker colors; identify first friction that’s hit 3 mentions and queue a `ship` task.
- Add `Next Touch Date` formula-driven reminders; ensure every participant has a future contact scheduled.

**Outreach & Sessions**

- Run 3 calls: 2 friends, 1 alpha stranger from Reddit/Discord. Use the same call flow and tag quotes with `#persona:<type>`.
- Experiment with a “Return Trigger” follow-up email 24 hours post-session (share one shipped tweak crediting them).

**Marketing & Narrative**

- Kick off the founder 3-day email sequence for the latest 10 signups and monitor replies; log top objections.
- Convert one friction insight into a “Before/After” LinkedIn carousel or Twitter thread.
- Publish a short blog or dev-notes recap titled “What 6 real conversations taught us this week”.

**Community Flywheel**

- Host Practice Lab #1, record highlight clips, and pull 2 quotes into the tracker as warm leads.
- Launch the `Community Stories` form and seed it with 2 example submissions.

---

## Week 3 — Expand Reach & Social Proof

**Feedback Ops**

- Audit tracker: confirm every participant has a status (e.g., `Active`, `Pending Follow-Up`, `Dormant`).
- Run COUNTIF on `#value` tags to surface breakthrough themes; prepare to showcase 2 as testimonials.

**Outreach & Sessions**

- Prioritize 1 paid alpha candidate (offer discount for feedback) and 2 existing participants for return sessions.
- Introduce a mini-survey before calls to capture stakes (relationship urgency vs. professional need).

**Marketing & Narrative**

- Launch the “Relationship Decay” narrative in a medium-length post (LinkedIn/Newsletter) that ends with Practice Lab invite.
- Post one “Build-in-public tweak” video showing a feature shipping in response to feedback.
- Run a community prompt: “What’s the hardest conversation you’ve had to navigate in Japanese?”; reply thoughtfully to every comment.

**Community Flywheel**

- Announce transparent AI usage guidelines (draft with AI, edit manually) and share across Reddit/Twitter.
- Convert highlight clips into a short montage for TikTok/Reels; include CTA to join next Lab or book a call.

---

## Week 4 — Layer in Viral Hooks & Prepare Scale

**Feedback Ops**

- Finalize a monthly retro: top 3 value moments, top 3 friction patterns, actions taken, outcomes.
- Evaluate Kanban throughput (ship/test/story) and decide which items graduate to roadmap vs. archive.

**Outreach & Sessions**

- Run 2 return sessions to validate changes + 1 new cold outreach call (community referral or founder email reply).
- Introduce incentives for referrals: offer “Practice Lab Priority + personalized study plan” for any friend they bring.

**Marketing & Narrative**

- Release “The Tokyo Test” v1 (Notion or Google Form) and plug it in founder email Day 2 + community posts.
- Share a “Wins & Fixes” public thread summarizing the month, linking to changelog and next month’s focus.
- Cross-post best performing content to LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, and newsletter; note channel metrics in tracker.

**Community Flywheel**

- Host an AMA featuring 2 alpha users; prep questions from earlier sessions and stream highlight quotes.
- Publish mini-case study (“How [Name] went from 30% to 80% understood at family dinner in 3 weeks”) using real call data.

---

## Friend Outreach Session Flow (Use Every Call)

1. **Set Context (3 min)** – Thank them, state you want friction, confirm narration and interruptions anytime.
2. **Baseline Snapshot (5 min)** – Capture current practice routine and stakes; log quotes with tags.
3. **Live Walkthrough (15 min)** – Observe silently unless blocked; note hesitation, skipped elements, CX pain.
4. **Deep Dive (5 min)** – Explore friction or surprises while fresh.
5. **Rapid Debrief (2 min)** – Ask:
   - Moment of value — “What felt genuinely useful?”
   - Point of friction — “Where did you feel confused or stuck?”
   - Return trigger — “What would bring you back tomorrow?”
   - Bonus: “What were you expecting that you didn’t see?”
6. **After the Session** – Send thank-you + one learning, log tracker recap, invite to feedback circle, and push action items to Kanban.

## Founder Email Engine (Runs Weekly)

- **Target**: Every new signup without a conversation in 72 hours.
- **Sequence**:
  - Day 1 (24h): Welcome + “just try one 3-minute conversation” CTA.
  - Day 2 (48h): Objection handling email (time, anxiety, confusion).
  - Day 3 (72h): Personal offer to talk with booking link.
- **Ops Notes**:
  - Send from `Hiro <hiro@trykaiwa.com>` with reply-to same address.
  - Track `founder_email_sent`, `founder_email_clicked`, `calendar_booking`, `email_conversion` in PostHog.
  - Reply to every response within 4 hours; log objections using inline tags (`#objection:time`, `#objection:confidence`).
  - When a user replies or books, add them to the tracker and schedule follow-up call in Tuesday/Saturday slots.

---

## Content & Campaign Recipes

- **Weekly Content Rhythm**:
  - `User Breakthrough` — share a verbatim quote tied to a solved friction.
  - `Build-in-Public Tweak` — show what shipped due to feedback (loom or screenshot).
  - `Community Prompt` — question that invites real stories (e.g., Midnight Test scenario).
- **Narrative Anchors** (cycle through):
  - “Love shouldn’t need subtitles” (relationship urgency).
  - “The 70% Campaign” (only a fraction of the real you is seen).
  - “Relationship Decay” (each mistranslation is a micro-betrayal).
  - “Grandparent Clock” (heritage urgency).
- **Channel Plays**:
  - Reddit: founder story → invite to Practice Lab + transparent roadmap.
  - LinkedIn/Twitter: thread summarizing real sessions; end with call to join community or book session.
  - TikTok/Reels: highlight clips from Practice Lab; overlay CTA “Want a dry run before meeting their parents?”
  - Email newsletter: weekly changelog formatted as “What we shipped / What we’re hearing / What’s next”.

Document performance each Sunday: impressions, saves, replies, DMs, conversions.

---

## Reddit & Unique Value Proposition Plays

- **Lead with stakes, not vocab**: Position Kaiwa as the tool for handling high-stakes relationship conversations (meeting parents, resolving conflict, celebrating milestones) instead of generic language drills.
- **Share “Practice Lab Case Files”**: Post anonymized session snapshots (situation, friction, fix) that show real emotional stakes; invite Redditors to submit their own scenarios for live practice.
- **Offer “Relationship Translator” tips**: Weekly thread where you break down a cultural nuance, apology script, or family-dinner survival phrase — include emotional context and when to use it.
- **AMA & Interview Series**: Reach out to YouTube/TikTok language tutors and bilingual couples for 20-minute AMAs or co-hosted Practice Labs; publish recap clips and tag collaborators so they share with their audience.
- **Community-built scenario bank**: Let Redditors vote on the next Kaiwa scenario (e.g., “meeting future in-laws”) and stream the build process; deliver the finished scenario back to the subreddit.
- **Proof through changelog**: After every Reddit-driven improvement, post the update link + credit the thread that inspired it to create a feedback loop and encourage sharing.
- **Teach “Human Filters”**: Contrast Kaiwa’s human-centered coaching with AI-polished apps by breaking down real mistakes, how Kaiwa corrects them mid-dialogue, and how users feel safer practicing sensitive conversations.
- **Referral storytelling**: Encourage alpha users to share their practice wins; provide them with a short narrative template (“Before/After/What changed”) plus a personal invite link.

---

## Alpha User Acquisition & Word-of-Mouth

- **Positioning**: Frame alpha as “inner circle” helping save relationships from “slow death by Google Translate.” Offer perks: priority practice slots, custom study plan, shout-out in changelog.
- **Where to Advertise** (low-cost):
  - Founder emails (Day 3) → calendar link with “Alpha Access” wording.
  - Practice Lab announcements → include “Bring a friend and both get 2 extra sessions.”
  - Relevant subreddits/Discord servers → lead with story + explicit ask for alpha partners.
  - Personal network DM blitz every Friday (5 outreach messages).
- **Word-of-Mouth Flywheel**:
  - Immediately credit users in changelog and send them the snippet to share.
  - Provide sharable assets (quote card, short Loom) after each improvement tied to their feedback.
  - Implement “Referral Notes” column in tracker with reward status (e.g., `Pending gift`, `Reward sent`).
  - Ask in follow-up email: “Who else needs this conversation practice before [event]? Introduce us and I’ll prep a session for both of you.”
  - Celebrate community wins publicly (LinkedIn/Twitter shout-outs + VIP circle ping) to reinforce social proof.

**Paid ads**: Defer broad spend until funnels are dialed. Instead, test $50 micro-campaigns (retargeting or highly targeted keywords like “meet Japanese parents”) only if organic sources cannot fill 6 alpha slots/week.

---

## Metrics & Review Ritual

- **Weekly**: sessions run, new insights logged, action items shipped, founder email metrics, social engagement that led to DMs/bookings.
- **Monthly Retro (Week 4 Friday)**:
  - Top 3 value moments, top 3 friction issues, actions taken, outcomes observed.
  - Which campaigns drove alpha signups?
  - What do we double down on vs. drop next month?
- Archive all notes + changelog snapshots for compounding evidence when talking to users, investors, or community leaders.
