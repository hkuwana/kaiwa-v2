## 🎯 The Four Content Pillars of the Signal Plan

**Format**: Blog posts, how-to guides, video walkthroughs, newsletter deep-dives
**Cadence**: 1-2x per week
**Distribution**: Blog, email newsletter, LinkedIn, YouTube shorts

## 📝 Content Creation Guidelines

### The "Signal Filter" Checklist

Before publishing, ask yourself:

1. **Does it focus on emotional outcome, not features?**
   - ❌ "We added real-time feedback to scenario playback"
   - ✅ "Real-time feedback helps you feel less alone in the moment"

2. **Does it tell a real story or is it generic advice?**
   - ❌ "5 ways to build language confidence"
   - ✅ "How Sarah went from silent at dinner to speaking naturally"

3. **Could I say this to a friend?**
   - ❌ "Leverage our proprietary AI engine..."
   - ✅ "We use the same AI that powers ChatGPT, but trained on real conversations"

4. **Does it reference what I'm actually building/learning NOW?**
   - ❌ "The importance of practice" (timeless but vague)
   - ✅ "This week we shipped reflection journaling because users asked: 'Did it actually work?'"

5. **Is there one real number or story?**
   - ❌ "Many users find success"
   - ✅ "3 users reported breakthrough conversations this week"
