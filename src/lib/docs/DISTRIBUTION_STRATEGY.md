## üî• The Brutal Truth

People in relationships don't have a language problem. They have a **connection emergency**. Every mistranslation is a small betrayal. Every family gathering where they can't participate is a reminder they don't belong.

We're not teaching language. We're **saving relationships from slow death by Google Translate**.

The urgency is real: Every day they wait, they drift further from the people they love.

That's not philosophy. That's fact. And that's what we sell.
