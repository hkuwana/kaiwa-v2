# Solo Founder Daily Execution Plan: The Signal-Focused Action System

> **North Star**: Give users the specific, practiced skills to have a single, successful, high-stakes conversation with a loved one.

This is a repeatable daily structure you can follow every day, every week, to execute on the Signal Plan's four phases: Acquisition â†’ Onboarding â†’ Retention â†’ Real-World Bridge.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Persona-Driven Execution

**You are NOT building for everyone.** Focus on your Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs). See [icp-personas.md](icp-personas.md) for full details.

### Your Core ICPs (In Priority Order)

1. **Sofia (Bilingual Spouse)** â€” Primary focus (Phase 1)
   - Signal: "How to impress my partner's parents in their language"
   - Fear: Judgment, inadequacy, ruining the relationship
   - LTV: 5-10 years (evolving milestones: meeting parents â†’ moving together â†’ having kids â†’ moving abroad)

2. **David (Heritage Speaker)** â€” Secondary focus (Phase 2)
   - Signal: "Reconnect with family without shame"
   - Fear: Disconnection, fraud, cultural loss
   - LTV: 10+ years (cyclical: reunions, family calls, cultural identity)

3. **Jamie (Relocation Expat)** â€” Tertiary focus (Phase 3)
   - Signal: "Make a real life in this new country"
   - Fear: Isolation, outsider status, career stagnation
   - LTV: 2-5 years (job relocation cycle)

4. **Rosa (Permanent Immigrant)** â€” Future focus (Phase 4)
   - Signal: "Pass exams and build belonging"
   - Fear: Professional inadequacy, discrimination, identity loss
   - LTV: 5-10+ years (career + permanent residency timeline)

**Decision**: Which persona resonates most with YOU? That's the one to obsess over first. (Recommend: Sofia.)

## Daily Operating System: The 4-Hour Block Structure

Each day has **four anchoring blocks** (60â€“75 minutes each) that can repeat weekly. You choose which day does what, but the rhythm stays consistent.

### Block 1: Morning Practice & Signal Testing (08:00â€“09:15)
**Goal**: Use Kaiwa yourself to find and test the Signal.

- Run one high-stakes scenario in your target language (e.g., "Telling your parents news," "Apologizing," "Meeting the family")
- Record your session (screen + notes)
- Note one "Moment of Value": What did you practice that actually felt real?
- Note one "Point of Friction": What was hard or unclear?
- Document in a quick template: **Scenario | Insight | Next Tweak**

**Output**: Raw practice session + one actionable insight for the day.

---

### Block 2: Content & Narrative (11:00â€“12:15)
**Goal**: Turn practice into proof. Tailor to your chosen ICP.

This is where you translate your morning practice into something shareable and real. **Every post should resonate with your target persona's fear/love signal.**

**Choose one daily task (rotate by persona):**

1. **User Breakthrough Narrative** (2â€“3x/week)
   - Take your morning practice or a user's story
   - Write as: "I was afraid to [moment]. Here's what I practiced. Here's what happened."
   - Include one specific detail or quote
   - One sentence: the breakthrough moment
   - **Persona angle**: If you're targeting Sofia, make her the hero: "I was terrified to meet his parents. Here's what I practiced..."

2. **Build-in-Public Post** (2â€“3x/week)
   - Document a product tweak or discovery you made during practice
   - Format: "We noticed [friction] â†’ We tested [solution] â†’ Result: [outcome]"
   - One number (if possible): "3 Sofia-type users struggled with this" or "80% found emotional scenarios more helpful"
   - **Persona angle**: Frame friction/solutions through your ICP's lens (e.g., "Sofia users told us emotional nuance matters more than grammar")

3. **Decision Journal** (1x/week)
   - Why did you ship what you shipped?
   - "We built [feature] because [user need, tied to persona]. Result: [data or feedback]"
   - Be honest about what worked and what didn't
   - **Persona angle**: "We built scenario customization because heritage speakers like David told us 'one-size-fits-all' doesn't work"

4. **"How We Built It" Technical Essay** (1x/month)
   - Explain one Kaiwa feature in human terms
   - No jargon; explain why it matters to your persona
   - **Persona angle**: "Why emotional AI feedback matters more than grammar correction (for people like Sofia)"

5. **Persona Deep-Dive** (1x/month, rotate personas)
   - Write a detailed "A day in the life of Sofia/David/Jamie/Rosa"
   - Show their fear, their practice, their breakthrough
   - This becomes your SEO anchor + conversion magnet

**Output**: One publishable post or narrative artifact that speaks to your current ICP.

---

### Block 3: Outreach & Growth (16:00â€“17:15)
**Goal**: Keep the feedback loop warm. Focus on your chosen ICP's natural acquisition channels.

**Daily core tasks:**
- Update the **Feedback OS** (your tracker of contacts, segments, next touch dates, persona type)
- Send **3 personalized messages** to warm leads, prioritizing your ICP:
  - 1 new person from your ICP's natural networks (see channels below)
  - 2 follow-ups to people you've already touched

**Persona-Specific Acquisition Channels** (Rotate by Day or Persona Focus)

**If targeting Sofia (Bilingual Spouse):**
- Reddit: r/JapaneseLanguage, r/relationships, r/IAmA, r/LearnJapanese
- TikTok: Search #bilingualcouple, #meetingtheparents, #internationalcouple
- Facebook: Bilingual family groups, expat dating groups
- Organic: "How to impress boyfriend's parents in Japanese" (Google + Reddit)
- Outreach hook: "I'm in your exact situationâ€”here's what worked for me"

**If targeting David (Heritage Speaker):**
- Reddit: r/Spanish, r/heritage_speakers, r/culture
- Facebook: Heritage language community groups, Spanish-language family groups
- Email: Spanish organizations, cultural centers, reunion planning groups
- Organic: "Reconnect with family in Spanish," "Heritage shame"
- Outreach hook: "You're not starting from zero. You just need permission."

**If targeting Jamie (Relocation Expat):**
- Reddit: r/expats, r/IWantOut, r/Berlin, r/Auswandern
- Facebook: Expat groups (city-specific)
- LinkedIn: Job changers, visa announcements, career pivots
- Organic: "Make friends in [language]," "Expat [city] guide"

- Email: Immigration orgs, nursing associations, visa sponsorship programs
- Organic: "Medical English," "IELTS passing," "Belonging in [country]"
- Outreach hook: "You're qualified. You belong. Let's make sure they know it."

**Weekly outreach themes** (rotate these):
- **Tuesday**: Acquisition focus â€” Use persona-specific hook; "What's the one conversation you're dreading?"
- **Wednesday**: Friend walk-throughs â€” Host a 20-min session with someone matching your target persona; capture their 3 critical questions
- **Thursday**: Community outreach â€” Post your Build-in-Public content on persona-specific Reddit/Facebook communities
- **Friday**: Warm leads follow-up â€” Check in with people in your ICP who've shown interest; share one new insight
- **Saturday**: Practice Lab or Group Session â€” Host 1â€“2 people matching your ICP; collect testimonials and real conversation examples
- **Sunday**: Network refresh â€” Audit your ICP prospect list (aim for 12 warm leads per persona); decide next week's outreach targets
- **Monday**: Confidence reminder â€” Send a personal email to past users matching your ICP; link to this week's persona-specific content

**Output**: Outreach completed, new ICP-aligned warm leads captured, feedback loop active, higher-quality conversions.

---

### Block 4: Reflection & Planning (19:00â€“20:15)
**Goal**: Connect the dots and plan tomorrow. Track ICP-specific metrics.

- **Wins & Fixes Log**: What shipped or improved today? What's still broken? (Tag by persona)
- **Pattern Tracker**: Tag all observations from practice + outreach with themes:
  - `#friction:[thing]` (e.g., `#friction:onboarding-confusion`)
  - `#value:[thing]` (e.g., `#value:emotional-safety`)
  - `#request:[feature]` (e.g., `#request:offline-mode`)
  - `#persona:[name]` (e.g., `#persona:sofia`, `#persona:david`)
- **Commitment Model Check**: For users in your paid tier:
  - Sessions completed this week (track toward 8/month goal)
  - Real conversations documented (track toward 1+/month goal)
  - Who's at risk of not hitting commitment? (Flag for re-engagement)
  - Who overachieved? (Gather testimonials, convert to referrals)
- **Next Day Preview**: What's tomorrow's practice scenario? What insight are you hunting for? (Aligned to current ICP focus)
- **Weekly Sprint Check** (Sunday only):
  - Did you hit your targets? (5+ practice sessions, 4+ posts, 15+ outreach touches)
  - What patterns emerged by persona?
  - Which persona is resonating most? (Usage, feedback quality, commitment completion)
  - What's the priority for next week?

**Output**: Updated tracker, logged insights, tomorrow's plan is clear, commitment model metrics documented.

## The Feedback OS: Your Single Source of Truth (ICP-Focused)

Keep one **master tracking sheet** with these columns (add persona-specific tracking):

| Name | Persona | Signal | Segment | Use Case | Acquisition Source | Last Contacted | Next Touch Date | Status | Tier | Sessions/Month | Real Conversations | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|---------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Sofia | Bilingual Spouse | Impress parents | couples | meeting-family | Reddit DM | 2025-01-15 | 2025-01-22 | warm-lead | $19 commitment | 6/8 | 0/1 | On track for completion; needs real conversation doc |
| David | Heritage Speaker | Reconnect without shame | heritage | family-reunion | Facebook group | 2025-01-10 | 2025-01-24 | trial-user | free | 10/8 | 1/1 | Over-delivered; high engagement; upsell candidate |
| Jamie | Relocation Expat | Build real life in Berlin | expat | making-friends | Reddit r/expats | 2025-01-08 | 2025-01-20 | prospects | free | â€” | â€” | Cold outreach; no response yet |
| Rosa | Permanent Immigrant | Pass IELTS + belong | immigrant | professional-english | LinkedIn | 2025-01-12 | 2025-02-01 | contacted | free | â€” | â€” | Interested; follow up with free trial offer |

**Supporting template for each session:**

```markdown
# [Name] â€” Kaiwa Feedback Session

- **Date:** [Date]
- **Segment / Role:** [e.g., bilingual couple, language teacher]
- **Conversation they're dreading:** [Their core need]

## Three Critical Questions

- **Moment of Value:** When did they feel "this could actually work"?
- **Point of Friction:** Where did they get stuck or confused?
- **Return Trigger:** What would make them come back?

## Raw Observations

- [Observation with inline tags, e.g., #value:emotional-safety]
- [Observation]

## Verbatim Quotes

> "Quote that hit you"

## Action Items

- [ ] Ship [feature/tweak] based on this feedback
- [ ] Follow up on [date] to share results
```

**Auto-tracking with formulas:**
- Add a `Pattern Tracker` tab that counts tag mentions (e.g., COUNTIF for `#friction:*`)
- Color-code tags to surface rising themes (1st mention = green, 2nd = yellow, 3rd+ = red)
- Create a Kanban linked to the tracker: `ship`, `test`, `story` (for product, content, and follow-up tasks)

---

## Automation & Consistency Hooks

Set these reminders to keep the system running:

- **Daily 07:45 AM**: Block calendar for 08:00â€“09:15 practice block
- **Daily 10:45 AM**: Reminder to start content block
- **Daily 15:45 PM**: Reminder to update tracker before outreach
- **Daily 18:45 PM**: Reminder to reflect and plan tomorrow
- **Sunday 19:00 PM**: Weekly sprint review checklist
- **After every call/session**: Auto-trigger a templated follow-up task (via Google Calendar or Zapier)

Use Apps Script or Zapier to auto-populate the tracker's "Next Touch Date" column with formulas (Last Contacted + your chosen cadence).

---

## Weekly Scoreboard (Review Every Sunday)

Track these metrics to ensure you're hitting the Signal targets:

**Practice & Product:**
- `# Kaiwa practice sessions / week` (Target: â‰¥5)
- `# Insights tagged in tracker` (Target: â‰¥10)
- `# Product tweaks shipped` (linked to user feedback)

**Content & Narrative:**

---

## Commitment-Based Pricing & Retention Model

This is your **money-back guarantee + relational proof system** that keeps users engaged for years, not weeks.

### The Monthly Commitment Tier: $19/month

**How it works:**
1. User pays $19 upfront
2. **At month-end, they get refunded if they complete:**
   - âœ… 8 practice sessions (objectively tracked)
   - âœ… 1 real conversation documented (optional bonus: +$5 credit)
3. **Net cost to user if they complete**: $9-14/month (or free next month if they hit bonus)
4. **Resets monthly** (no one-time "event cliff" churn)

### Why This Works for Each Persona

| Persona | Skin in Game | Real Conversation = ? |
|---------|---|---|
| Sofia | $19 commitment = serious about meeting parents | Voice memo/transcript of convo with Yuto = proof it works |
| David | $19 = accountability for family reunion prep | Call with abuela = healing validation |
| Jamie | $19 = monthly check-in for integration | Dinner with new friends = belonging proof |
| Rosa | $19 = exam prep intensity matching | Patient interaction documented = professional win |

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] **Define "session completion"**: What counts? (Minimum 5 min? 10 min? Must have output?)
- [ ] **Define "real conversation proof"**: Voice memo? Transcript? Journal entry + screenshot of texts? Partner confirmation?
- [ ] **Set up tracking dashboard**: Session count, conversation docs submitted, at-risk users (e.g., "3 days left, 2 sessions to go")
- [ ] **Create email automation**:
  - Day 1 of month: "You're in. Here's your 8-session challenge. Let's go."
  - Day 20: "On track! X sessions done, Y to go."
  - Day 25: "Crunch time! 3 sessions left, 6 days left. You got this."
  - Day 30: "You made it! Refunding $5 now. Wanna hit the bonus next month?"
- [ ] **Manual payout (MVP)**: Spreadsheet tracking of sessions/conversations; Stripe refunds by hand for first 10 users
- [ ] **Auto-payout (Phase 2)**: Build dashboard with auto-refund logic once validated

### Real Conversation Proof Template

User submits one of these (pick one):

**Option 1: Voice Memo**
- Record a 30-90 sec voice memo of you practicing OR a real conversation snippet
- Upload to app or email
- Auto-flagged for you to review (takes 2 min)

**Option 2: Transcript**
- Paste a transcript of a real conversation with partner/family/friend
- Include timestamp and context ("Dinner with Yuto's parents, Jan 15")

**Option 3: Journal Entry**
- 2-3 paragraphs: "I practiced [scenario]. Here's what happened in real life: [outcome]."
- Feels like a "win log" not a burden

**Why this matters**: You're measuring the ONE thing that proves Kaiwa works: **actual relationship impact**, not just app usage.

## Immediate Setup Checklist

**Phase 1: Core Foundation**
- [ ] **Read & choose your primary ICP** (See [icp-personas.md](icp-personas.md); recommend: Sofia)
- [ ] **Duplicate the feedback session template** in Google Docs; link each participant row to their doc
- [ ] **Set up the master tracker** with columns: `Name`, `Persona`, `Signal`, `Segment`, `Use Case`, `Acquisition Source`, `Priority`, `Last Contacted`, `Next Touch Date`, `Status`, `Tier`, `Sessions/Month`, `Real Conversations`
- [ ] **Add formula columns**: `Next Touch Date` = `Last Contacted + cadence` (adjust cadence per segment/persona)
- [ ] **Create Pattern Tracker tab** with auto-counting COUNTIF rules for tagged insights (tag by persona)
- [ ] **Stand up a Kanban** (Trello, Linear, or GitHub Projects) with `ship`, `test`, `story` labels (filter by persona)

**Phase 2: Operations**
- [ ] **Block your calendar** with the four daily blocks (08:00â€“09:15, 11:00â€“12:15, 16:00â€“17:15, 19:00â€“20:15) as recurring weekly events
- [ ] **Set automation reminders** via Google Calendar, Zapier, or Apps Script
- [ ] **Draft a content calendar** aligned with weekly sprint themes (see content-calendar-2025.md); **tag each piece by target persona**

**Phase 3: Commitment Model (MVP)**
- [ ] **Define session completion criteria** (e.g., min 5 min, must generate output)
- [ ] **Define real conversation proof options** (voice memo, transcript, or journal entry)
- [ ] **Create manual tracking spreadsheet**: Columns = `User`, `Month`, `Sessions Completed`, `Real Conversation?`, `Refund Amount`, `Status`
- [ ] **Draft email sequences** for day 1, 20, 25, 30 of commitment month
- [ ] **Test with first 3 users**: Manual payout; gather feedback on "does this feel fair?"

**Phase 4: Scaling & Automation**
- [ ] **Build commitment dashboard** in app (session tracker, real conversation submission form)
- [ ] **Automate email reminders** (Zapier or custom scheduled job)
- [ ] **Implement auto-refund logic** (Stripe API)
- [ ] **Track metrics** by persona: avg completion rate, real conversation doc rate, retention after month 1

## Reference & Philosophy

This plan exists to execute the **Signal Plan**:

1. **User Acquisition** â€” Your outreach + content proves you understand the emotional problem (Block 3 + 2)
2. **User Onboarding** â€” Your practice sessions + "Moment of Value" insights show you how to onboard fast (Block 1)
3. **User Retention** â€” Your content loop keeps users engaged with real scenarios (Block 2)
4. **Real-World Bridge** â€” Your feedback OS + prep plan system captures the payoff (Block 4 + future feature)

Every block feeds into the next. Practice â†’ Narrative â†’ Outreach â†’ Reflection â†’ Better Practice.

Keep this plan alongside your actual Kaiwa app and tracker so the daily execution stays connected to the product vision.
