# Solo Founder Daily Execution Plan: The Signal-Focused Action System

> **North Star**: Give users the specific, practiced skills to have a single, successful, high-stakes conversation with a loved one.

This is a repeatable daily structure you can follow every day, every week, to execute on the Signal Plan's four phases: Acquisition → Onboarding → Retention → Real-World Bridge.

---

## 🎯 Persona-Driven Execution

**You are NOT building for everyone.** Focus on your Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs). See [icp-personas.md](icp-personas.md) for full details.

### Your Core ICPs (In Priority Order)

1. **Sofia (Bilingual Spouse)** — Primary focus (Phase 1)
   - Signal: "How to impress my partner's parents in their language"
   - Fear: Judgment, inadequacy, ruining the relationship
   - LTV: 5-10 years (evolving milestones: meeting parents → moving together → having kids → moving abroad)

2. **David (Heritage Speaker)** — Secondary focus (Phase 2)
   - Signal: "Reconnect with family without shame"
   - Fear: Disconnection, fraud, cultural loss
   - LTV: 10+ years (cyclical: reunions, family calls, cultural identity)

3. **Jamie (Relocation Expat)** — Tertiary focus (Phase 3)
   - Signal: "Make a real life in this new country"
   - Fear: Isolation, outsider status, career stagnation
   - LTV: 2-5 years (job relocation cycle)

4. **Rosa (Permanent Immigrant)** — Future focus (Phase 4)
   - Signal: "Pass exams and build belonging"
   - Fear: Professional inadequacy, discrimination, identity loss
   - LTV: 5-10+ years (career + permanent residency timeline)

**Decision**: Which persona resonates most with YOU? That's the one to obsess over first. (Recommend: Sofia.)

## Daily Operating System: The 4-Hour Block Structure

Each day has **four anchoring blocks** (60–75 minutes each) that can repeat weekly. You choose which day does what, but the rhythm stays consistent.

### Block 1: Morning Practice & Signal Testing (08:00–09:15)

**Goal**: Use Kaiwa yourself to find and test the Signal.

- Run one high-stakes scenario in your target language (e.g., "Telling your parents news," "Apologizing," "Meeting the family")
- Record your session (screen + notes)
- Note one "Moment of Value": What did you practice that actually felt real?
- Note one "Point of Friction": What was hard or unclear?
- Document in a quick template: **Scenario | Insight | Next Tweak**

**Output**: Raw practice session + one actionable insight for the day.

---

### Block 2: Content & Narrative (11:00–12:15)

**Goal**: Turn practice into proof. Tailor to your chosen ICP.

This is where you translate your morning practice into something shareable and real. **Every post should resonate with your target persona's fear/love signal.**

**Choose one daily task (rotate by persona):**

1. **User Breakthrough Narrative** (2–3x/week)
   - Take your morning practice or a user's story
   - Write as: "I was afraid to [moment]. Here's what I practiced. Here's what happened."
   - Include one specific detail or quote
   - One sentence: the breakthrough moment
   - **Persona angle**: If you're targeting Sofia, make her the hero: "I was terrified to meet his parents. Here's what I practiced..."

2. **Build-in-Public Post** (2–3x/week)
   - Document a product tweak or discovery you made during practice
   - Format: "We noticed [friction] → We tested [solution] → Result: [outcome]"
   - One number (if possible): "3 Sofia-type users struggled with this" or "80% found emotional scenarios more helpful"
   - **Persona angle**: Frame friction/solutions through your ICP's lens (e.g., "Sofia users told us emotional nuance matters more than grammar")

3. **Decision Journal** (1x/week)
   - Why did you ship what you shipped?
   - "We built [feature] because [user need, tied to persona]. Result: [data or feedback]"
   - Be honest about what worked and what didn't
   - **Persona angle**: "We built scenario customization because heritage speakers like David told us 'one-size-fits-all' doesn't work"

4. **"How We Built It" Technical Essay** (1x/month)
   - Explain one Kaiwa feature in human terms
   - No jargon; explain why it matters to your persona
   - **Persona angle**: "Why emotional AI feedback matters more than grammar correction (for people like Sofia)"

5. **Persona Deep-Dive** (1x/month, rotate personas)
   - Write a detailed "A day in the life of Sofia/David/Jamie/Rosa"
   - Show their fear, their practice, their breakthrough
   - This becomes your SEO anchor + conversion magnet

**Output**: One publishable post or narrative artifact that speaks to your current ICP.

---

### Block 3: Outreach & Growth (16:00–17:15)

**Goal**: Keep the feedback loop warm. Focus on your chosen ICP's natural acquisition channels.

**Daily core tasks:**

- **WhatsApp Founding Member Group** (10-15 min):
  - Check group messages (respond within 2-4 hours)
  - Post one check-in or motivational message
  - Celebrate any wins members share
  - Answer questions
  - **See full strategy**: [whatsapp-founding-member-strategy.md](whatsapp-founding-member-strategy.md)
- Update the **Feedback OS** (your tracker of contacts, segments, next touch dates, persona type)
- Send **3 personalized messages** to warm leads, prioritizing your ICP:
  - 1 new person from your ICP's natural networks (see channels below)
  - 2 follow-ups to people you've already touched

**Persona-Specific Acquisition Channels** (Rotate by Day or Persona Focus)

- **Saturday**: Practice Lab or Group Session — Host 1–2 people matching your ICP; collect testimonials and real conversation examples
- **Sunday**: Network refresh — Audit your ICP prospect list (aim for 12 warm leads per persona); decide next week's outreach targets

**WhatsApp-Specific Weekly Rhythms:**
- **Monday**: Motivation post ("Who's practicing today?")
- **Wednesday**: Mid-week check-in prompt
- **Friday**: Wins celebration ("Drop one win from this week")
- **Bi-weekly**: Feature voting poll

### Block 4: Reflection & Planning (19:00–20:15)

**Goal**: Connect the dots and plan tomorrow. Track ICP-specific metrics.

- **Wins & Fixes Log**: What shipped or improved today? What's still broken? (Tag by persona)

  - `#friction:[thing]` (e.g., `#friction:onboarding-confusion`)
  - `#value:[thing]` (e.g., `#value:emotional-safety`)
  - `#request:[feature]` (e.g., `#request:offline-mode`)
  - `#persona:[name]` (e.g., `#persona:sofia`, `#persona:david`)
- **Commitment Model Check**: For users in your paid tier:
  - Sessions completed this week (track toward 8/month goal)
  - Real conversations documented (track toward 1+/month goal)
  - Who's at risk of not hitting commitment? (Flag for re-engagement)
  - Who overachieved? (Gather testimonials, convert to referrals)
- **Next Day Preview**: What's tomorrow's practice scenario? What insight are you hunting for? (Aligned to current ICP focus)
- **Weekly Sprint Check** (Sunday only):
  - Did you hit your targets? (5+ practice sessions, 4+ posts, 15+ outreach touches)
  - What patterns emerged by persona?
  - Which persona is resonating most? (Usage, feedback quality, commitment completion)
  - What's the priority for next week?

**Output**: Updated tracker, logged insights, tomorrow's plan is clear, commitment model metrics documented.

## The Feedback OS: Your Single Source of Truth (ICP-Focused)

Keep one **master tracking sheet** with these columns (add persona-specific tracking):

| Name  | Persona             | Signal                    | Segment   | Use Case             | Acquisition Source | Last Contacted | Next Touch Date | Status     | Tier           | Sessions/Month | Real Conversations | Notes                                                |
| ----- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | --------------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Sofia | Bilingual Spouse    | Impress parents           | couples   | meeting-family       | Reddit DM          | 2025-01-15     | 2025-01-22      | warm-lead  | $19 commitment | 6/8            | 0/1                | On track for completion; needs real conversation doc |

| Rosa  | Permanent Immigrant | Pass IELTS + belong       | immigrant | professional-english | LinkedIn           | 2025-01-12     | 2025-02-01      | contacted  | free           | —              | —                  | Interested; follow up with free trial offer          |

**Supporting template for each session:**

```markdown
# [Name] — Kaiwa Feedback Session

- **Date:** [Date]
- **Segment / Role:** [e.g., bilingual couple, language teacher]
- **Conversation they're dreading:** [Their core need]

## Three Critical Questions

- **Moment of Value:** When did they feel "this could actually work"?
- **Point of Friction:** Where did they get stuck or confused?
- **Return Trigger:** What would make them come back?

## Raw Observations

- [Observation with inline tags, e.g., #value:emotional-safety]
- [Observation]

## Verbatim Quotes

> "Quote that hit you"

## Action Items

- [ ] Ship [feature/tweak] based on this feedback
- [ ] Follow up on [date] to share results
```

**Auto-tracking with formulas:**

- Add a `Pattern Tracker` tab that counts tag mentions (e.g., COUNTIF for `#friction:*`)
- Color-code tags to surface rising themes (1st mention = green, 2nd = yellow, 3rd+ = red)
- Create a Kanban linked to the tracker: `ship`, `test`, `story` (for product, content, and follow-up tasks)

---

## Automation & Consistency Hooks

Set these reminders to keep the system running:

- **Daily 07:45 AM**: Block calendar for 08:00–09:15 practice block
- **Daily 10:45 AM**: Reminder to start content block
- **Daily 15:45 PM**: Reminder to update tracker before outreach
- **Daily 18:45 PM**: Reminder to reflect and plan tomorrow
- **Sunday 19:00 PM**: Weekly sprint review checklist
- **After every call/session**: Auto-trigger a templated follow-up task (via Google Calendar or Zapier)

Use Apps Script or Zapier to auto-populate the tracker's "Next Touch Date" column with formulas (Last Contacted + your chosen cadence).

---

## Weekly Scoreboard (Review Every Sunday)

Track these metrics to ensure you're hitting the Signal targets:

**Practice & Product:**

- `# Kaiwa practice sessions / week` (Target: ≥5)
- `# Insights tagged in tracker` (Target: ≥10)
- `# Product tweaks shipped` (linked to user feedback)

**Content & Narrative:**

- `# Artifacts published / week` (User Breakthroughs, Build-in-Public, Decision Journals, essays)
- `# Cross-platform amplifications` (e.g., Reddit post → LinkedIn → email reach)

**Growth & Outreach:**

- `# New conversations booked` (warm leads → trial/session)
- `# Follow-ups completed` (target: 6–8/week)
- `# Testimonials or referrals collected`

**Conversion & Retention:**

- `# Trials → paid conversions`
- `# Practice Lab attendees` (target: 3–5/week)
- `# Repeat session bookings` (sign of product-market fit)

---

## Commitment-Based Pricing & Retention Model

This is your **money-back guarantee + relational proof system** that keeps users engaged for years, not weeks.

### The Monthly Commitment Tier: $19/month

**How it works:**

1. User pays $19 upfront
2. **At month-end, they get refunded if they complete:**
   - ✅ 8 practice sessions (objectively tracked)
   - ✅ 1 real conversation documented (optional bonus: +$5 credit)
3. **Net cost to user if they complete**: $9-14/month (or free next month if they hit bonus)
4. **Resets monthly** (no one-time "event cliff" churn)

### Why This Works for Each Persona

| Persona | Skin in Game                                   | Real Conversation = ?                                     |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sofia   | $19 commitment = serious about meeting parents | Voice memo/transcript of convo with Yuto = proof it works |
| David   | $19 = accountability for family reunion prep   | Call with abuela = healing validation                     |
| Jamie   | $19 = monthly check-in for integration         | Dinner with new friends = belonging proof                 |
| Rosa    | $19 = exam prep intensity matching             | Patient interaction documented = professional win         |

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] **Define "session completion"**: What counts? (Minimum 5 min? 10 min? Must have output?)
- [ ] **Define "real conversation proof"**: Voice memo? Transcript? Journal entry + screenshot of texts? Partner confirmation?
- [ ] **Set up tracking dashboard**: Session count, conversation docs submitted, at-risk users (e.g., "3 days left, 2 sessions to go")
- [ ] **Create email automation**:
  - Day 1 of month: "You're in. Here's your 8-session challenge. Let's go."
  - Day 20: "On track! X sessions done, Y to go."
  - Day 25: "Crunch time! 3 sessions left, 6 days left. You got this."
  - Day 30: "You made it! Refunding $5 now. Wanna hit the bonus next month?"
- [ ] **Manual payout (MVP)**: Spreadsheet tracking of sessions/conversations; Stripe refunds by hand for first 10 users
- [ ] **Auto-payout (Phase 2)**: Build dashboard with auto-refund logic once validated

### Real Conversation Proof Template

User submits one of these (pick one):

**Option 1: Voice Memo**

- Record a 30-90 sec voice memo of you practicing OR a real conversation snippet
- Upload to app or email
- Auto-flagged for you to review (takes 2 min)

**Option 2: Transcript**

- Paste a transcript of a real conversation with partner/family/friend
- Include timestamp and context ("Dinner with Yuto's parents, Jan 15")

**Option 3: Journal Entry**

- 2-3 paragraphs: "I practiced [scenario]. Here's what happened in real life: [outcome]."
- Feels like a "win log" not a burden

**Why this matters**: You're measuring the ONE thing that proves Kaiwa works: **actual relationship impact**, not just app usage.

- [ ] **Set automation reminders** via Google Calendar, Zapier, or Apps Script
- [ ] **Draft a content calendar** aligned with weekly sprint themes (see content-calendar-2025.md); **tag each piece by target persona**

**Phase 3: Commitment Model (MVP)**

- [ ] **Define session completion criteria** (e.g., min 5 min, must generate output)
- [ ] **Define real conversation proof options** (voice memo, transcript, or journal entry)
- [ ] **Create manual tracking spreadsheet**: Columns = `User`, `Month`, `Sessions Completed`, `Real Conversation?`, `Refund Amount`, `Status`
- [ ] **Draft email sequences** for day 1, 20, 25, 30 of commitment month

- [ ] **Automate email reminders** (Zapier or custom scheduled job)
- [ ] **Implement auto-refund logic** (Stripe API)
- [ ] **Track metrics** by persona: avg completion rate, real conversation doc rate, retention after month 1

## Reference & Philosophy

This plan exists to execute the **Signal Plan**:

1. **User Acquisition** — Your outreach + content proves you understand the emotional problem (Block 3 + 2)
2. **User Onboarding** — Your practice sessions + "Moment of Value" insights show you how to onboard fast (Block 1)
3. **User Retention** — Your content loop keeps users engaged with real scenarios (Block 2)
4. **Real-World Bridge** — Your feedback OS + prep plan system captures the payoff (Block 4 + future feature)

Every block feeds into the next. Practice → Narrative → Outreach → Reflection → Better Practice.

Keep this plan alongside your actual Kaiwa app and tracker so the daily execution stays connected to the product vision.
