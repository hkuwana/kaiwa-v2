### Your Personal Ranking Criteria

Rate each option on a scale of 1-10 for each criterion:

#### 1. **Enjoyment**
*Will I actually enjoy doing this? Or will it drain me?*

#### 2. **Operational Load**
*How much time/energy does this require to maintain?*

#### 3. **What I Want to Be Known For**
*Does this align with "helping people connect with loved ones without subtitles"?*

#### 4. **Speed to Cash**
*How quickly can this generate revenue? (Days? Weeks? Months?)*

#### 5. **Leverage/Compounding**
*Does this work keep paying off over time? (e.g., SEO posts rank forever)*

#### 6. **Personal Story Alignment**
*Can I tell the "I couldn't talk to my Japanese grandparents" story here?*

## Part 4: Question the "Rules"

> "For each option you've been stuck on, ask: 'What rule am I following that might not exist?'"

### Assumptions to Challenge

**Rule:** "I MUST post on Instagram/TikTok to succeed"
- **Reality:** Your customers are on Reddit/Quora searching for solutions, not scrolling for entertainment
- **What if:** You skip social media entirely for 90 days?

**Rule:** "I MUST build features before marketing"
- **Reality:** You have $15 MRR not because of missing features, but missing distribution
- **What if:** You completely stop coding for 30 days?

**Rule:** "I MUST take sales calls to sell high-ticket"
- **Reality:** You sold coaching with just a sales page + email (you already proved this wrong!)
- **What if:** You sell $49 bootcamps entirely via Reddit comments → email sequence?

**Rule:** "I MUST have a big audience before launching paid offers"
- **Reality:** You could pre-sell a bootcamp to 5 people you interviewed
- **What if:** You DM your 10 beta users today and ask if they'd pay $49 for group practice?

**Rule:** "I MUST write perfect, long-form content"
- **Reality:** 300-word helpful Reddit comments can drive signups
- **What if:** You only write comments, never articles?

**Rule:** "I MUST scale to everyone learning languages"
- **Reality:** Sofia (bilingual spouse meeting parents) is a tighter, more emotional niche
- **What if:** You ONLY market to people meeting their partner's family for the next 90 days?

**Rule:** "I MUST be professional and polished"
- **Reality:** Vulnerability and founder journey content builds trust faster
- **What if:** You post your revenue numbers publicly every week? ($15 MRR → $50 → $200...)

**Rule:** "I MUST give away value for free first"
- **Reality:** People pay for solutions to painful problems immediately
- **What if:** Your first Reddit comment ends with "I'm running a bootcamp for this, $49, starts Monday"?

**Rule:** "I MUST focus on acquisition before retention"
- **Reality:** Your 7-10 beta users are your best marketing channel
- **What if:** You turn them into raving fans who refer 2-3 friends each?

**Rule:** "I MUST follow the 30-day sprint plan exactly as written"
- **Reality:** Plans are hypotheses; only you know what feels right
- **What if:** You modify it based on what gives you energy vs drains you?

## Part 5: Follow Your Heart

> "Once everything is out of your brain, no amount of strategy or rumination will help. Flip your whiteboard. All that's left is to follow your intuition."

### Reflection Questions

After filling out Parts 1-4, close your laptop. Go for a walk. Then come back and answer:

   _______________________________________________

3. **If you could only do ONE marketing activity for the next 30 days, which would you choose?**

   _______________________________________________

4. **What marketing activity have you been avoiding because it's "not professional enough" or "too vulnerable"?**

   _______________________________________________

5. **If you had to hit $1,000 MRR in 30 days and failure meant shutting down Kaiwa forever, what would you do FIRST tomorrow morning?**

   _______________________________________________

6. **What would you do if you couldn't code for 30 days? (Seriously, what would you do?)**

   _______________________________________________

7. **What does your gut say about the Reddit-first strategy in DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY.md?**
   - [ ] Hell yes, this feels right

## Part 8: Emergency "I'm Going Back to Coding" Circuit Breaker

If you catch yourself thinking "I just need to build this one feature first..." come back here.

### Ask Yourself:

1. **Is this feature directly blocking a sale?** (Has a customer said "I'll pay if you add X"?)
   - Yes → Build it
   - No → It's procrastination

2. **Am I coding because talking to strangers feels uncomfortable?**
   - Be honest: _______________

3. **What am I avoiding right now?**
   - [ ] Posting on Reddit (fear of rejection)
   - [ ] Asking for money (fear of hearing "no")
   - [ ] DMing potential customers (fear of being "salesy")
   - [ ] Sharing my grandparents story (fear of being vulnerable)
   - [ ] Other: _______________

4. **What would happen if I did that scary thing RIGHT NOW?**
   - Worst case: _______________
   - Best case: _______________
   - Most likely case: _______________

### The 5-Minute Rule:
Set a timer. Do the scary marketing thing for 5 minutes. If you hate it after 5 minutes, you can go back to coding.

**Spoiler:** You won't hate it. And you'll realize coding was the hiding place all along.

## Final Note

This whiteboard exercise isn't about finding the "perfect" strategy. It's about externalizing your thoughts so you can see them clearly. It's about questioning the rules you're following that don't actually exist. And it's about following your intuition once all the noise is out of your head.

**Your distribution strategy is already solid. The question is: Will you actually execute it? Or will you go back to coding?**

Now fill this out. Be brutally honest. And then go make your first Reddit comment.

The clock is ticking.
