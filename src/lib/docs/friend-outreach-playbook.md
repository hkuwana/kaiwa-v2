# Friend Outreach Playbook

Purpose: guide friends and early supporters through a 25-30 minute Kaiwa session, surface actionable feedback, and keep them engaged with product updates.

---

## 1. Before You Reach Out

- Pick 3–5 friends who match your ideal learner profile (need real conversation practice, upcoming stakes, willing to be honest).
- DM or text them personally; let them know you want to hop on a 25-30 minute call so they can try Kaiwa while you listen.
- Ask them to come ready to share screens, narrate their thoughts out loud, and ask you questions the moment they feel confused.

**Quick message template**

```
Hey &lt;Name&gt;! Can I ask you for a huge favor? Would you be down to hop on a quick 25-30 min call this week or next and let me watch you try Kaiwa? I'm trying to figure out where people get stuck.
```

## 2. 25-30 Minute Call Flow

1. **Set context (3 min)**  
   Thank them, explain you’re not looking for compliments — you want friction. Confirm they’ll narrate every thought and ask questions immediately.
2. **Baseline snapshot (5 min)**  
   Ask how they currently practice speaking and what they hope Kaiwa could help with. This primes the call and gives you motivation context.
3. **Live walkthrough (15 min)**  
   Have them sign in, launch multiple scenarios, and keep going until they reach the analysis screen. Do not intervene unless they are blocked; note where they hesitate, what they skip, and when they ask for help.
4. **Deep dive follow-up (5 min)**  
   Explore any major friction points or surprises from the walkthrough while details are fresh.
5. **Rapid debrief (2 min)**  
   Run through the three critical product questions (below) and capture verbatim quotes. Close by asking if they’d be open to future check-ins.

Take notes in a running doc or spreadsheet immediately after the call while details are fresh.

## 3. Three Critical Product Questions

Ask these right after they finish the scenario so the experience is vivid:

1. **Moment of value:** “What, if anything, felt genuinely useful or different about Kaiwa during that run?”  
   _You’re validating the core promise and identifying the strongest pull._
2. **Point of friction:** “Where did you feel confused, stuck, or tempted to quit?”  
   _Pinpoints UX gaps that stop people before analysis._
3. **Return trigger:** “What would have to happen for you to come back tomorrow and keep practicing here?”  
   _Signals the next feature or improvement that matters most._

If time allows, end with: “Is there anything missing that you expected to see?” for bonus insights.

## 4. WhatsApp Founding Member Strategy

> **See full strategy**: [whatsapp-founding-member-strategy.md](whatsapp-founding-member-strategy.md)

### Why WhatsApp > Other Channels

For Kaiwa's founding members, WhatsApp is the best choice because:

- **International-friendly**: Your users are dating internationally, expats, heritage speakers
- **Zero friction**: Everyone already has it and checks it 50x per day
- **High engagement**: Messages feel personal, not corporate
- **Age appropriate**: 25-35+ users prefer WhatsApp over Discord

### The Friend → WhatsApp → Founding Member Flow

**Step 1 - Initial DM** (before adding to WhatsApp):

```
Hey! Quick ask:

I'm launching Kaiwa with 10 founding members and want you in it.

What you'd get:
• Unlimited practice ($29/mo value) for $14/month forever
• Weekly practice labs + monthly 1-on-1 session
• Private WhatsApp group with direct access to me
• Direct line to tell me what's broken/working

What I need:
• Use it 2x/week
• 15-min monthly feedback call
• Honest feedback

No pressure if busy, but if you're down it'd be huge + you might find it useful for [their situation].

First 10 spots only. Let me know!
```

**Step 2 - Create WhatsApp Group** (when 2-3 friends say yes):

- Group name: `Kaiwa Founding Members 🗣️`
- Add your first 3-5 friends
- Post welcome message (see full strategy doc)

**Step 3 - Daily WhatsApp Rhythm**:

- **Morning (5 min)**: Check group, respond to messages, post motivational check-in
- **Evening (5 min)**: Celebrate wins, answer questions
- **Weekly**: Monday motivation, Friday reflection, bi-weekly feature voting

**Step 4 - Add Strangers** (Week 2+):

- Once you have 3-5 friends active, add strangers from Practice Lab/Reddit
- Friends set the tone, strangers join an already-active group
- This creates social proof and community feel

### WhatsApp Group Rules (Pin This)

```
Kaiwa Founding Members 🗣️

This is our private group for:
• Sharing wins (had your conversation? Tell us!)
• Quick feedback (bug? Feature idea? Drop it here)
• Practice support (need help prepping? Ask!)
• Community vibes (we're in this together)

Please:
✅ Share your wins (anonymously if you want)
✅ Ask questions anytime
✅ Support each other

Try to avoid:
❌ Off-topic conversations
❌ Spamming
```

## 5. Keeping Friends in the Loop

- **Daily WhatsApp engagement:** Check group 2x per day (morning + evening), respond within 2-4 hours, post 1 motivational message per day
- **Weekly WhatsApp prompts:** Monday motivation, Friday wins celebration, bi-weekly feature voting
- **Monthly personal DM check-ins:** Outside of group, DM each friend monthly: "Did you use it? What's confusing? What would make you use it more?"
- **Weekly two-bullet update:** Every Friday text or email a quick note: shipped this / learning this. Low effort, builds habit.
- **Public changelog or Notion page:** Share a lightweight "What's new" link they can check anytime; update it after each release.
- **Progress celebration pings:** When someone's feedback ships, tag them in the WhatsApp group with a thank-you. It reminds them their input matters.

---

## 6. After Each Session

- Send a short thank-you message with one thing you learned from them.
- Ask for their address to send them a thank you postcard.
- Log the three critical question answers in a central tracker so you can spot patterns quickly.
- Invite them to the feedback circle and promise to share how their input influenced the next release.

The goal is to keep friends close to the product, turn insights into deliberate iterations, and make sure you never build in the dark again.
