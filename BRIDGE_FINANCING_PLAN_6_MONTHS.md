# Kaiwa: 6-Month Bridge Financing Plan

**Date**: November 25, 2025
**Current MRR**: <$1,000
**Current Runway**: Needs assessment
**Goal**: Reach $3-5K MRR with validated retention in 6 months

---

## Where This Fits in the Global Plan

Across your strategy docs, time is broken into shared horizons:

- **Now (0–6 months)** – Bridge + validation: organic acquisition, reach $3–5K MRR, prove retention.
- **Next (6–18 months)** – Scale to $30K MRR and deepen core moats.
- **Later (18–36 months)** – Marketplace, B2B experiments, advanced speech analysis at scale.

This bridge plan **is the detailed playbook for the Now (0–6 months) horizon** and should be read alongside the 6–12 Month Execution Plan for what happens in **Next**.

---

## Executive Summary

### The Brutal Truth

You're at a critical inflection point. You have:

- ✅ A working product
- ✅ 7-10 beta users
- ✅ Clear ICP and execution plan
- ❌ Almost no revenue (<$1K MRR)
- ❌ Limited runway

**The most important thing for the next 6 months is NOT marketing or hiring - it's CUSTOMER ACQUISITION through low-cost, high-touch distribution.**

Your execution plan calls for aggressive paid advertising scaling ($2K → $15K/month). **This is premature.** You need to prove organic acquisition works FIRST before burning cash on ads.

### What You Actually Need

**Bridge Amount Needed**: $25,000 - $35,000 for 6 months

This covers:

- Reduced founder salary ($20K → $10K/year for 6 months)
- Essential operating expenses
- Minimal marketing spend ($500-1,000/month organic-first)
- NO paid ads until Month 4-5 (only if organic validates)

## 6-Month Bridge Financing Plan

### Conservative Scenario (Recommended)

**Assumption**: Focus on organic growth, validate before scaling paid ads

| Month       | MRR Target | Monthly Expenses | Net Burn | Strategy                                      |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Month 1** | $200       | $1,104           | -$904    | Organic only: Reddit, outreach, bootcamps     |
| **Month 2** | $500       | $1,604           | -$1,104  | Add $500/mo marketing (Fiverr creator, tools) |
| **Month 3** | $1,000     | $1,604           | -$604    | Continue organic + content                    |
| **Month 4** | $2,000     | $2,104           | -$104    | Test paid ads ($500/mo if organic validated)  |
| **Month 5** | $3,000     | $2,604           | +$396    | Scale ads to $1K/mo                           |
| **Month 6** | $4,000     | $2,604           | +$1,396  | Maintain                                      |

**Total Cash Need**: $2,320 net burn + $5,000 buffer = **$7,320**

**BUT** - Need cash upfront for expenses, so actual bridge: **$15,000 minimum**

### Moderate Scenario (Optimistic)

**Assumption**: Organic works well, scale faster in Month 3-4

| Month   | MRR Target | Monthly Expenses | Net Burn | Strategy                                      |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Month 1 | $300       | $1,104           | -$804    | Aggressive organic: bootcamps, PAB conversion |
| Month 2 | $800       | $1,604           | -$804    | Add Fiverr creator, scale content             |
| Month 3 | $1,500     | $2,104           | -$604    | Test $500/mo paid ads                         |
| Month 4 | $2,500     | $2,604           | -$104    | Scale to $1K/mo ads                           |
| Month 5 | $3,500     | $3,104           | +$396    | Scale to $1.5K/mo ads                         |
| Month 6 | $5,000     | $3,104           | +$1,896  | Maintain                                      |

**Total Cash Need**: $2,316 net burn + $5,000 buffer = **$7,316**

**Actual bridge need**: **$20,000** (more headroom for experiments)

### Aggressive Scenario (High Risk)

**Assumption**: Follow original 12-month execution plan (NOT RECOMMENDED for bridge)

| Month   | MRR Target | Monthly Expenses | Net Burn | Strategy                          |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| Month 1 | $600       | $3,104           | -$2,504  | $2K/mo paid ads immediately       |
| Month 2 | $1,200     | $3,604           | -$2,404  | Full salary restored, scale ads   |
| Month 3 | $2,400     | $5,104           | -$2,704  | $3K/mo ads + hire content creator |
| Month 4 | $4,000     | $7,104           | -$3,104  | $5K/mo ads                        |
| Month 5 | $6,000     | $7,104           | -$1,104  | Maintain                          |
| Month 6 | $8,800     | $7,104           | +$1,696  | Hit target                        |

**Total Cash Need**: $14,524 net burn + $5,000 buffer = **$19,524**

**Actual bridge need**: **$35,000+** (very risky without validation)

## The Most Important Thing: What Should You Focus On?

### ❌ What NOT to Do (Common Founder Traps)

1. **Don't start with paid ads** - Your conversion rate is 1%. Paying for traffic is burning money.
2. **Don't hire a marketing person yet** - You don't know what works. You need to do it yourself first.
3. **Don't optimize the product** - It's good enough. The problem is distribution, not features.
4. **Don't build more features** - Every hour coding is an hour not acquiring customers.

### ✅ What TO Do (Priority Order)

#### Priority 1: Validate Organic Acquisition (Months 1-3)

**Goal**: Get 30-50 paying users through $0 acquisition cost

**Why**: You need to prove people will pay AND that you can reach them cheaply before spending on ads or hiring.

**How**:

- **Week 1-2**: Do 10 customer interviews (pay $20 each). Understand their exact pain.
- **Week 3-4**: Launch $49 Practice Bootcamp (pre-sell before building it)
- **Daily (45 min)**: Reddit engagement in r/LongDistance, r/LearnJapanese, r/relationships
- **Weekly (3 hours)**: Write newsletter + Quora answers

**Success metrics**:

- 50+ email subscribers by end Month 1
- 5-10 bootcamp sales ($245-490) by end Month 2
- 30-50 paying Kaiwa users by end Month 3
- Clear data on which channel converts best

**If this fails**: You have a product-market fit problem, not a distribution problem. Pivot or shut down.

**If this succeeds**: You've proven the model. Now you can scale with confidence.

#### Priority 2: Test Low-Cost Marketing (Month 3-4)

**Only do this if Priority 1 is working**

**Budget**: $500-1,000/month

**Options**:

1. **Hire Fiverr creator** ($200-500/month)
   - Create 8-12 TikTok/Instagram Reels per month
   - Test hooks: language barrier, meeting parents, heritage shame
   - Track engagement and link clicks

2. **Run micro-influencer tests** ($500)
   - Find 5-10 bilingual couple accounts (1K-10K followers)
   - Offer free Premium in exchange for honest review
   - Track signups with custom links

3. **Paid ads micro-test** ($200-500)
   - Run $5-10/day Facebook/Instagram ads
   - Target: Women 25-35 in relationship, interest in Japan/Japanese
   - Goal: CAC < $100, otherwise kill immediately

**Success metrics**:

- At least ONE channel gets CAC < $75
- Conversion rate improves from 1% → 5%+
- MRR grows 30%+ month-over-month

#### Priority 3: Scale What Works (Month 5-6)

**Only do this if you've found a working channel**

- If Reddit works: 2x time investment, hire VA to help with engagement
- If content works: Increase Fiverr budget to $800-1,000/month
- If paid ads work: Scale to $1-2K/month with CAC target

## Specific Recommendations

### Should You Do Free Trials?

**Your question**: "Should I do free trials to get more data, or reach out to people who are recent or near recent grads to help with this?"

**Answer**: YES to trials, but structured correctly.

**Don't do**: Unlimited free tier with no friction

- You'll get tire-kickers who never pay
- No skin in the game = no commitment = no learning

**Do do**: 7-day trial with credit card required

- Forces qualification ("Is this worth $19 to me?")
- Creates urgency to try it NOW
- Converts at 15-25% if product delivers
- Lets you test messaging and onboarding

**Even better**: $49 Practice Bootcamp → Upsell to Monthly

- Charge $49 upfront for 5-day intensive bootcamp
- Deliver massive value (group Zoom calls + Kaiwa practice + Q&A)
- At end: "Want to keep practicing? $14/mo (normally $20)"
- Converts at 30-50% because you've built trust

### Should You Focus on Marketing or Hiring?

**Your question**: "Do you think it's marketing, or getting more people?"

**Answer**: Marketing (customer acquisition) is the bottleneck, NOT people.

**Why you don't need to hire yet**:

- You're pre-product-market fit
- You don't know what marketing works yet
- Hiring before validation = waste of money
- You need to do the uncomfortable work yourself first

**What you should do instead**:

1. **Months 1-3**: You do ALL distribution yourself (9 hrs/week)
   - This is uncomfortable but essential
   - You learn what resonates with customers
   - You build authentic relationships
   - You prove the model

2. **Month 4-5**: Hire part-time Fiverr help ($500-800/mo)
   - ONLY if organic is working
   - They execute your proven playbook
   - You focus on strategy + sales

3. **Month 6+**: Consider full-time hire
   - ONLY if you're at $3K+ MRR
   - ONLY if you've validated a repeatable acquisition channel

**Rule of thumb**: Don't hire until you're doing a task repeatedly that someone else could do for <50% of the revenue it generates.

### Should You Hire Marketing Person on Fiverr?

**Your question**: "I am also thinking of hiring some marketing person on the side to help me make a marketing plan on fiverr on tiktok and instagram"

**Answer**: YES, but not yet, and not for "making a plan"

**Wrong approach**:

- Hire someone to "make a marketing plan"
- Pay 5 people to "make videos for you"
- Hope one of them figures out your messaging

**Why this fails**:

- They don't understand your customers like you do
- Generic content won't resonate
- You'll waste $500-1,000 learning this

**Right approach**:

1. **Month 1-2**: YOU create 10-15 pieces of content yourself
   - Film yourself talking about your grandparent story
   - Interview your beta users and share their stories
   - Test different hooks: shame, love, fear of judgment

2. **Month 3**: Once you know what resonates
   - Hire ONE Fiverr creator ($300-500)
   - Give them your top 3 performing concepts
   - Ask them to create 8-12 variations
   - Track which ones drive signups

3. **Month 4+**: Scale the winner
   - If TikTok works: Pay creator to scale production
   - If Reddit works: Don't waste money on video, double down on Reddit
   - If neither works: Kill and try something else

**The key**: YOU must figure out the message first. Then hire for execution.

### Recent Grads - Good Idea?

**Your question**: "or reach out to people who are recent or near recent grads to help with this?"

**Answer**: It depends on what you mean

**If you mean**: Hire recent grads to help with marketing

- ❌ **No** - They don't have experience, you'll spend time training them
- Better to hire experienced Fiverr freelancers for specific tasks

**If you mean**: Target recent grads as customers

- ✅ **Yes** - Recent grads are GREAT for specific personas:
  - **Bilingual Spouse** (Sofia): 25-29, recent grad, in serious relationship
  - **Heritage Speaker** (David): 30-35, recent grad feeling disconnected from roots
  - These are your ICP! Target them aggressively on Reddit, TikTok, LinkedIn

**How to reach recent grads**:

- Reddit: r/GradSchool, r/StudentLoans (for context on life transition)
- LinkedIn: Connect with recent grads in language learning groups
- Facebook: University alumni groups for bilingual communities
- TikTok: #ClassOf2024, #PostGradLife + #BilingualCouple

## Bridge Financing Recommendation

### How Much Do You Actually Need?

**Minimum (Conservative Path)**: $15,000

- Covers 6 months at survival salary ($833/mo)
- Minimal marketing spend ($0-500/mo ramping up)
- Must hit revenue targets or you're out of runway

**Recommended (Moderate Path)**: $25,000

- Covers 6 months at reduced salary ($1,667/mo in months 4-6)
- Room for marketing experiments ($500-1,000/mo)
- Buffer for unexpected costs
- **This is my recommendation**

**Comfortable (Aggressive Path)**: $35,000

- Covers 6 months at reduced salary throughout
- Significant marketing budget ($2-5K/mo ramping)
- Can hire contractor in month 4-5
- Only raise this much if you have strong investor interest

### Where to Get the Money

**Option 1: Friends & Family**

- Fastest, most flexible
- Can be $10-25K typically
- Structure as convertible note (converts to equity in future round)

**Option 2: Angel Investors**

- Harder to close small amounts
- But if you have warm intros, could raise $25-50K
- Show them your execution plan + early traction

**Option 3: Revenue-Based Financing**

- Companies like Pipe, Clearco, Capchase
- But you need $2-3K MRR minimum (you're not there yet)
- Come back to this at Month 3-4 if hitting targets

**Option 4: Personal Savings / Credit**

- Last resort but fastest
- Be careful with credit card debt (high interest)
- Only do this if you're 100% committed

**Option 5: Grants / Accelerators**

- Apply to Techstars, Y Combinator, indie maker grants
- Takes 2-3 months, may be too slow
- But worth applying while you execute

### My Recommendation

**Raise $25,000 as follows**:

- $15,000 from friends & family (convertible note, $1M cap)
- $10,000 from personal savings / credit line
- This gives you 6 months to prove the model

**Use it like this**:

- Months 1-3: Burn $3-5K total (lean mode, organic only)
- Months 4-6: Burn $8-12K (ramp marketing if working)
- End of Month 6: You should be at $3-5K MRR, making this sustainable

**If you hit $5K MRR at Month 6**:

- You can raise a proper seed round ($500K-1M) or
- Go lifestyle business mode (profitable, slow growth) or
- Take another $25K bridge and push to $10K MRR

## Critical Success Factors

### What Would Make This Plan Fail

1. **You go back to coding instead of distributing**
   - Solution: Block coding time, force yourself to do sales 4 hrs/day

2. **You burn too fast on unvalidated channels**
   - Solution: Stick to $0 spend until Month 3, prove organic first

3. **You don't reach out because of fear**
   - Solution: Commit to 10 Reddit comments per day (non-negotiable)

4. **You hire too early**
   - Solution: No hires until Month 4, and only if hitting revenue targets

5. **You run out of money before validation**
   - Solution: Raise $25K not $15K, gives you margin for error

### What Would Make This Plan Succeed

1. **You become a distribution machine**
   - 9 hours/week on Reddit, Quora, outreach (non-negotiable)

2. **You charge upfront and validate willingness to pay**
   - $49 bootcamps, 7-day trials with CC required

3. **You stay lean until revenue covers costs**
   - No fancy tools, no hires, no paid ads until proven

4. **You talk to customers obsessively**
   - 2-3 interviews per week, understand their pain deeply

5. **You iterate messaging until it resonates**
   - Test different hooks, double down on what converts

## Questions I Have for You

To refine this plan further, I need to understand:

1. **Personal Financial Situation**:
   - How much personal savings do you have?
   - Can you survive on $833/month for 3 months? Or do you need more?
   - Do you have a partner with income who can support you?

2. **Fundraising Appetite**:
   - Are you willing to raise from friends & family?
   - Do you have any warm investor connections?
   - What's your tolerance for personal financial risk (credit cards, etc.)?

3. **Time Commitment**:
   - Can you commit to 9 hours/week on distribution for 6 months?
   - What's blocking you from doing sales/outreach right now?
   - Are you psychologically ready to be rejected by customers daily?

4. **Current Traction**:
   - How many active users do you have right now?
   - What's your current MRR exactly (you said <$1K but what is it)?
   - How many people have paid you ANYTHING?

5. **Competition to Focus**:
   - What else competes for your time? (Day job? Other projects?)
   - Can you go full-time on Kaiwa for 6 months?

---

## Final Recommendation

### TL;DR: What You Should Do

1. **Raise $25,000 bridge financing**
   - $15K from friends & family
   - $10K from savings or credit line

2. **Cut salary to $833/month for Months 1-3**
   - Increase to $1,667/month at Month 4 if hitting targets

3. **Optimize expenses immediately**
   - Cut Squarespace, QuickBooks, downgrade Google Workspace
   - Add Claude Pro (worth it for speed)
   - Get to ~$180/month base operating cost

4. **Focus 100% on organic distribution for 3 months**
   - NO paid ads, NO hires, NO new features
   - Reddit (45 min/day), Newsletter (weekly), Customer interviews (2-3/week)
   - Launch $49 bootcamps to validate willingness to pay

5. **Only add marketing spend at Month 3-4 IF organic is working**
   - Hire Fiverr creator ($500/mo)
   - Test micro paid ads ($500/mo)
   - Scale what converts

6. **Target: $3-5K MRR by Month 6**
   - This validates the model
   - Gives you optionality: raise seed, go lifestyle, or take another bridge

7. **Don't hire anyone until Month 6**
   - Only exception: Part-time Fiverr creator in Month 4-5
   - You need to figure out what works first

## Appendix: Scenarios & Sensitivity Analysis

### If You Raise $15K (Minimum)

- ✅ Can survive 6 months at $833/mo salary
- ✅ Minimal marketing budget ($0-500/mo)
- ❌ No room for error or experiments
- ❌ Cannot hire anyone
- ❌ High stress

**Outcome**: 60% chance you hit $2-3K MRR, 40% chance you run out of money

### If You Raise $25K (Recommended)

- ✅ Can survive 6 months at $833-1,667/mo salary
- ✅ Room for marketing experiments ($500-1,000/mo)
- ✅ Can hire part-time help in Month 4-5
- ✅ Buffer for unexpected costs
- ✅ Less stress

**Outcome**: 75% chance you hit $3-5K MRR, 25% chance you don't validate

### If You Raise $35K (Aggressive)

- ✅ Can pay yourself reasonably ($1,667/mo throughout)
- ✅ Significant marketing budget ($2-5K/mo)
- ✅ Can hire contractor in Month 4
- ✅ Lots of room to experiment
- ❌ More dilution if convertible note
- ❌ Higher expectations from investors

**Outcome**: 80% chance you hit $5-8K MRR, 20% chance you waste money on unvalidated channels

### If You Don't Raise (Bootstrap)

- ✅ No dilution, full ownership
- ❌ Can only pay yourself $0-833/mo (unsustainable)
- ❌ Zero marketing budget
- ❌ High stress, likely to quit
- ❌ Will take 12+ months to hit $3K MRR

**Outcome**: 30% chance you hit $2K MRR, 70% chance you burn out and quit

**Verdict**: Don't bootstrap. Raise at least $20K.

---

## Conclusion

**The most important thing for the next 6 months is NOT marketing or hiring - it's PROVING CUSTOMERS WILL PAY through low-cost organic acquisition.**

Your 12-month execution plan is solid but too aggressive for a bridge round. You need to:

1. **De-risk the model first** (Months 1-3): Prove organic works, get to $1-2K MRR
2. **Test paid channels second** (Months 4-5): Add marketing budget ONLY if organic validated
3. **Scale what works third** (Month 6+): Double down on working channels

**Bridge Financing Need**: $20,000 - $25,000

**Expected Outcome**: $3-5K MRR at Month 6, validated model, ready for seed round or lifestyle business path

**Your Job**: Stop coding, start selling. 9 hours/week distribution, non-negotiable.

Now go make your first Reddit comment and conduct your first customer interview. The clock is ticking.
