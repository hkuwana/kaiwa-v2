## Pro Tips

**Keep it conversational**: Write like you're texting a friend, not marketing copy

**Focus on "why"**: Users care why you built something, not just what it is

**Be brief**: 1-2 sentences per item is perfect

**Show progress**: Even small wins count (bug fixes, performance improvements)

**Be honest**: If you didn't ship much, say so! Users appreciate transparency

## Calendar Reminder

Import `kaiwa-founder-reminders.ics` to get reminded:
