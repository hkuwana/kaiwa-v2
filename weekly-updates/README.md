# Weekly Updates System

This directory contains weekly update files that are automatically included in the Kaiwa newsletter.

## File Naming Convention

Create files with the format: `Updates-MM-DD-YYYY.md`

Examples:

- `Updates-01-25-2025.md` for January 25, 2025
- `Updates-02-01-2025.md` for February 1, 2025

## File Structure

Each weekly update file should follow this markdown structure:

```markdown
# Week of [Date]

## What Shipped

- **Feature Name**: Description of what was built
- **Another Feature**: Description with [optional link](https://example.com)

## Highlights

- **Improvement**: What got better this week
- **Performance**: Any performance improvements

## Coming Up Next

- **Next Feature**: What's being worked on
- **Planned Improvement**: Future enhancements

## Notes

Any additional notes or context for the week.
```

## How It Works

1. Create your weekly update file in this directory
2. The system automatically detects the most recent file
3. Content is parsed and included in the weekly digest email
4. Files are organized by date for easy reference

## Tips

- Keep updates concise but informative
- Include links to relevant features or documentation
- Use consistent formatting for better parsing
- Add emojis sparingly for visual appeal
- Focus on user-facing changes and improvements
