## Afternoon Block (90 min): Content Repurposing

### Task 3: Turn Your Videos into a Carousel (45 min)

**Take your two videos from Days 3 & 5** and turn them into an Instagram/LinkedIn carousel.

**Carousel Structure** (8 slides):

**Slide 1 (Cover)**:
```
The 3-Phrase Framework for Meeting Your Partner's Japanese Parents

(Without the anxiety)
```

**Slide 2**:
```
The fear is real:

"What if they think I'm not good enough?"
"What if I can't express how I care about their son/daughter?"
"What if I freeze?"

Here's what actually matters →
```

**Slide 3**:
```
Phrase 1:
はじめまして、[name]と申します

"Nice to meet you" (humble form)

Why it works: Shows respect from the first moment
```

**Slide 4**:
```
Phrase 2:
いつも[partner]にお世話になっています

"Thank you for raising [partner]"

Why it works: Acknowledges their role in your partner's life
```

**Slide 5**:
```
Phrase 3:
まだ勉強中ですが、頑張ります

"I'm still learning but I'll do my best"

Why it works: Shows humility and commitment
```

**Slide 6**:
```
3 Things NOT to Say:

❌ "日本語が上手" - Sounds arrogant
❌ Over-apologizing every 5 seconds
❌ "I don't understand" without trying

Remember: They're watching how you try, not if you're perfect
```

**Slide 7**:
```
The Truth:

Perfect grammar doesn't build bridges.
Sincere effort does.

They're not judging your Japanese level.
They're judging your sincerity.
```

**Slide 8 (CTA)**:
```

## Copy-Paste Scripts for Today

### Response to "I love the carousel!"

```
Thank you! Glad it resonated.

I'm actually running a free Practice Lab tomorrow (Saturday) where we practice this exact conversation live.

Would you want to join? It's intimate (5-6 people) and super helpful if you're preparing for this conversation.

DM me if you're interested!
```

### Response to "Do you have this for [other language]?"

```
Not yet, but I'm adding languages based on demand!

What language are you learning and what conversation are you preparing for?

If I get 3-5 people asking for the same thing, I'll create it. You'd be first to know.
```

### Response to article comments

```
Thanks for reading! This comes from working directly with people preparing for these exact moments.

The gap between "knowing words" and "saying what matters" is what I'm trying to close with Kaiwa.

What conversation are YOU preparing for?
```
