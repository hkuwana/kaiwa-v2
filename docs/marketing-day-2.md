## Afternoon Block (90 min): Twitter/X Presence

### Task 3: Create Your Twitter Thread (60 min)

**Your First Twitter Thread About Your Story**

**Copy & Customize**:

```
Thread: Why I couldn't talk to my grandparents (and why I'm building Kaiwa)

1/ I grew up with Japanese grandparents I couldn't really talk to.

Not because we didn't love each other. But because language apps taught me "This is a pen" instead of "I'm proud of you."

2/ Here's what I wish I'd known:

Language learning isn't about perfect grammar.
It's about having ONE real conversation.

The moment when your partner's mom understands you're serious about her son.
The moment when you finally tell your abuela you love her without translating.

3/ That's why traditional apps fail us.

They optimize for:
→ Streaks
→ Points
→ Gamification

But real conversations aren't a game.
They're the moments that define our relationships.

4/ So I'm building Kaiwa.

Not for people who want to "learn Japanese."
For people who need to:
→ Meet their partner's parents
→ Apologize in a way that heals
→ Share big news with family

Practice the conversations that matter.

5/ We're early. Beta. Messy.

But if you've ever felt the gap between "knowing words" and "saying what you mean" in someone else's language...

If you've ever needed to have ONE conversation that scares you...

I want to help.

6/ What's the ONE conversation you're afraid to have?

Reply below. I read every one.
```

**Action**: Post this thread on Twitter/X now.

### Task 4: Cross-Post to LinkedIn (30 min)

Take the same thread concept and reformat it for LinkedIn as a single post:

**LinkedIn Version**:

```
Language apps taught me "This is a pen."

They never taught me how to tell my Japanese grandparents "I'm proud of you."

There's a gap between knowing words and saying what you actually mean.

That gap costs us:
→ Relationships with partners' families
→ Connections with our heritage
→ Moments we'll never get back

I'm building Kaiwa to close that gap.

Not for people chasing streaks or points.
For people who need to have ONE real conversation:
• Meeting your partner's parents
• Apologizing in a way that heals
• Sharing big news with family

We're early. Beta. Real.

What's the ONE conversation you're afraid to have in another language?

I want to hear your story.

#languagelearning #buildinginpublic #relationships #kaiwa
```

**Action**: Post this on LinkedIn now.

This resonates. [Reference specific point they made]

## Copy-Paste Scripts for Today

### Response to "How much does Kaiwa cost?"

```
Right now I'm in early beta and working with people individually to understand what they need.

For context, I'm testing a $19/month commitment model where you get most of it back if you complete your practice sessions.

But honestly, I'm more interested in understanding your situation first. What conversation are you preparing for?
```

### Response to "This is exactly what I need!"

```
I'm so glad this resonates!

Tell me more about your situation:
- What's the conversation you're preparing for?
- When is it happening?
- What are you most nervous about?

I'd love to help you prepare for this. Can I send you some specific resources?
```

### Response to criticism or skepticism

```
That's fair feedback. [Acknowledge their point]

Here's my thinking: [Explain your perspective briefly]

But I'm definitely still learning. What would make this more valuable for someone in your situation?
```
