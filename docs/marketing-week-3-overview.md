## Day 15: Testimonial Video Creation

**Video Testimonial Request Template**:
```
Hey [Name]!

Your feedback about Practice Lab has been amazing.

Quick ask: Would you be comfortable recording a 30-60 second video testimonial?

Just answer these 3 questions on camera (phone video is perfect):
1. What were you worried about before Practice Lab?
2. What helped most from the session?
3. How do you feel now about your upcoming conversation?

Totally understand if you're not comfortable on camera - no pressure at all!

But if you are, it would really help show others what these sessions are about.

Let me know!
```

**Afternoon** (90 min):
- Create testimonial compilation video (if you got any videos)
- OR create text-based testimonial graphics (Canva)

**Testimonial Graphic Template** (Create 5-7 of these):
```
[Background: Soft gradient or solid color]

"This 45-minute session was more valuable than 2 years of Duolingo for this specific conversation."

**Morning** (60 min):

# Case File #2: How David Finally Talked to His Abuela

**Published**: [Date]

---

## The Situation

David grew up in California. His parents were from Mexico, but they only spoke English at home.

He's 35 now. His Spanish comprehension is decent, but he can't produce it.

His abuela (grandmother) only speaks Spanish.

The ticking clock: Family reunion in 6 weeks. He hasn't really talked to her in 10 years.

His text to me: "I feel like a fraud."

---

## The Shame

This isn't about grammar. It's about identity.

David looks Mexican. He has the name. He has the family.

But he can't talk to his own grandmother.

"They'll think I'm just another whitewashed kid who forgot where he came from."

Sound familiar?

---

## The Preparation

We focused on emotional vocabulary, not textbook phrases.

**Not**: "¿Cómo estás?" (How are you?)
**But**: "Te extraño, abuela." (I miss you, grandma.)

**Not**: "El gato es negro." (The cat is black.)
**But**: "Estoy orgulloso de ser tu nieto." (I'm proud to be your grandson.)

The phrases that matter:
• "Perdóname por no hablar más" (Forgive me for not speaking more)
• "Quiero conocerte mejor" (I want to know you better)
• "Cuéntame de cuando eras joven" (Tell me about when you were young)

---

## The Breakthrough

In our second practice session, David said something that stuck with me:

"I've been so afraid of sounding stupid that I chose silence. Silence is worse."

That's when it clicked for him.

His abuela doesn't care about his accent.
She cares that he's trying.

---

## The Result

David called her before the reunion.

Just 5 minutes. Voice shaking. Stumbling over words.

He said: "Abuela, te extraño. Perdóname por no llamarte más. Quiero hablar contigo."

She cried.

He texted me after: "She kept saying 'mi amor, mi amor.' I understood that."

At the reunion, they sat together for an hour. He didn't understand everything.

But they held hands.

Connection doesn't require perfection.

---

## If You're Like David

Maybe you're a heritage speaker who lost the language.

Maybe you grew up between cultures and feel like you don't fully belong to either.

Maybe you have family members you love, but can't really talk to.

Here's the truth:

You're not starting from zero.
You're starting from love.

The language is in you somewhere. It's in your name, your face, your family's stories.

You just need permission to sound like yourself again.

---

## Want Help?

Whether it's Spanish, Cantonese, Tagalog, Arabic - the fear is the same.

I run Practice Labs every Saturday for heritage speakers reconnecting with family.

Next session: [Date + Time]
DM me "HERITAGE" if you want in.

You belong. Let's prove it to yourself.
