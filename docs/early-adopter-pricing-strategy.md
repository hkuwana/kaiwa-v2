# Kaiwa Early Adopter & Product Advisor Program

**Strategic Pricing & Structure for First 20 Users**

---

## The Problem You're Solving

As an early-stage founder, you need:
1. **Engaged users** who actually use the product (not just sign up)
2. **Honest feedback** on what works and what doesn't
3. **Testimonials & case studies** for marketing
4. **Revenue validation** (even small amounts prove willingness to pay)
5. **Product direction** (what features to build next)

You DON'T need:
- Passive users who sign up and ghost
- Maximum revenue right now (you need learning more)
- People who want "everything for free forever"

---

## Recommended Tier Structure

### Tier 1: "Founding Member" (10 spots) - $14/month

**What they get**:
- Premium features (normally $29/month)
- **Lifetime price lock** at $14/month (NEVER goes up, even as you add features)
- Weekly Practice Labs (group sessions)
- 1 personal 1-on-1 session per month (30 min)
- Direct access to you (Slack/Discord/WhatsApp group)
- "Founding Member" badge in app
- First access to all new features
- Name in "Hall of Fame" on website (if they want)

**What you get from them**:
- **Required**: Use Kaiwa 2x per week minimum (trackable)
- **Required**: Monthly 15-min feedback call with you
- **Required**: Document 1 real conversation per month (voice memo, transcript, or journal)
- **Requested**: Testimonial when they have a win
- **Requested**: Refer 1 friend (not required, but encouraged)

**Why $14 not free**:
- Free = no commitment, people ghost
- $14 = "I'm serious about this" signal
- Still feels like an amazing deal (50% off Premium)
- You validate people WILL pay for this

**Why 10 spots**:
- Small enough to give everyone personal attention
- Large enough to get diverse feedback
- Creates urgency ("Only 10 founding spots!")

---

### Tier 2: "Product Advisor" (10 spots) - $19/month

**What they get**:
- Premium features (normally $29/month)
- **Lifetime price lock** at $19/month

**What you get from them**:
- **Required**: Use Kaiwa 1x per week minimum
- **Required**: Quarterly feedback survey (detailed)
- **Requested**: Vote on feature priorities

- **Requested**: Testimonial when appropriate

**Why $19 not $14**:
- Less intensive commitment on their side

- Validates your standard "Plus" pricing ($19 is your future baseline)

**Why 10 spots**:
- Gives you 20 total engaged users (statistically meaningful)
- Different commitment level attracts different personas

---

### Tier 4: "Premium" (Launch later) - $29/month

**What they get**:
- All Plus features
- Unlimited scenarios (Plus might have limits)

## The Value Proposition (How to Pitch It)

### For Founding Members

**Subject**: "10 Founding Member Spots - Premium Access at 50% Off Forever"

```
I'm looking for 10 people to shape Kaiwa's future.

Here's the deal:

You get:
• Premium access (normally $29/month) for $14/month
• Locked at $14 FOREVER (even when we add more features)
• Weekly Practice Labs with me personally
• 1-on-1 session every month (30 min)
• Direct line to me (private Slack group)
• Your name in our Founding Members hall of fame

I get:
• Your honest feedback (monthly 15-min calls)
• You actually using it (2x/week minimum)
• Your story (testimonials when you have wins)

Why so cheap? Because I need to learn what works.

You're not just a customer - you're co-building this with me.

Only 10 spots. First come, first served.

Interested? Reply with:
1. Your situation (what conversation you're preparing for)
2. Why you want to be a founding member
3. Can you commit to 2x/week usage?

If it's a fit, I'll send you the payment link.

- [Your name]

P.S. This is the lowest price Kaiwa will EVER be. When we launch publicly, it's $29/month minimum.
```

---

### For Product Advisors

**Subject**: "10 Product Advisor Spots - Help Shape Kaiwa"

```
After founding members, I'm opening 10 Product Advisor spots.

You get:
• Premium features for $19/month (normally $29)
• Price locked forever at $19 (even as we grow)
• Weekly Practice Labs
• Quarterly check-ins with me
• Early access to new features
• Voice in what we build next

I get:
• Your feedback quarterly (detailed surveys)
• You testing new features before launch

Less intensive than Founding Member tier, but still influential.

Only 10 spots. After this, it's $29/month for everyone.

Want in? Reply with:
1. Your situation
2. What feature you most want to see
3. Can you commit to 1x/week usage?

- [Your name]
```

---

## Financial Model

### Month 1 (If you fill all 20 spots)

**Revenue**:
- 10 Founding Members × $14 = $140/month
- 10 Product Advisors × $19 = $190/month
- **Total MRR: $330**

**Not huge, but**:
- You validated 20 people will pay
- You have 20 engaged users giving feedback
- You have 20 potential testimonials
- You're learning 20x faster than building in a vacuum

---

### Month 3 (After launching Plus tier)

**Revenue**:
- 10 Founding Members × $14 = $140/month (locked)
- 10 Product Advisors × $19 = $190/month (locked)
- 20 Plus tier × $19 = $380/month (new signups)
- **Total MRR: $710**

Now you're approaching $1K MRR with 40 customers.

---

### Month 6 (After launching Premium tier)

**Revenue**:
- 10 Founding Members × $14 = $140 (locked)
- 10 Product Advisors × $19 = $190 (locked)
- 30 Plus tier × $19 = $570
- 10 Premium tier × $29 = $290
- **Total MRR: $1,190**

You just crossed $1K MRR with 60 customers.

**Your founding members are still paying $14** (you're "losing" $15/month per person), but:
- They were there when you had nothing
- They gave you the feedback to build Premium tier
- They're your best marketers (referrals)
- **The lifetime loyalty is worth way more than $15/month**

---

## Smart Moves

### 1. Grandfather Clause (Critical)

**Promise**: "Your price is locked FOREVER. Even when we add features, even when we raise prices, even when we're huge - you pay $14/month for life."

**Why this works**:
- Creates insane loyalty
- They become your biggest advocates
- They feel like VIPs
- Word-of-mouth marketing is priceless

**Example**: Buffer did this with their first 1000 customers. Those customers are STILL evangelists 10+ years later.

---

### 2. The Commitment Model (Keeps Them Engaged)

**For Founding Members**:
```
Your $14/month commitment:

✅ Use Kaiwa 2x per week (we track this)
✅ Monthly 15-min feedback call
✅ Document 1 real conversation per month

If you don't hit these, you're still charged $14 (we don't kick you out).

But we'll check in: "Hey, what's blocking you? How can we help?"

This commitment keeps YOU accountable to your goals.
```

**Why this works**:
- Passive users = worthless for learning
- Engaged users = goldmine of insights
- The commitment filters for serious people
- You're helping them succeed (not just taking money)

---

### 3. The Monthly Check-In (Your Secret Weapon)

**For Founding Members** (monthly 15-min call):

**Your script**:
```
Hi [Name], time for our monthly Kaiwa check-in!

Quick 15 minutes. I want to know:

1. What worked this month?
2. What frustrated you?
3. Did you have your real conversation yet? How'd it go?
4. If you could change ONE thing about Kaiwa, what would it be?
5. Are you on track with your 2x/week commitment? If not, what's blocking you?

Your feedback literally decides what I build next.

Thanks for being a founding member!
```

**You'll learn more in 10 of these calls than 100 analytics dashboards.**

---

### 4. The Slack/Discord Group (Community = Retention)

**Create a private group for Founding Members + Product Advisors**:

**Channels**:
- `#wins` - People share their breakthrough moments
- `#feedback` - Direct line to you for bugs/requests
- `#feature-voting` - They vote on what you build next
- `#practice-partners` - They practice with each other
- `#general` - Community vibes

**Why this works**:
- Peer accountability (they practice together)
- Social proof (seeing others' wins motivates them)
- Direct feedback loop (no survey delays)
- Community = retention (they stay for the people, not just the product)

---

## The Ask (What You Require vs Request)

### Required (Non-negotiable)

**Founding Members**:
- ✅ 2x/week minimum usage
- ✅ Monthly 15-min feedback call
- ✅ Document 1 real conversation/month

**Product Advisors**:
- ✅ 1x/week minimum usage
- ✅ Quarterly detailed feedback survey

**If they don't meet requirements**:
- Don't kick them out (bad look)
- Check in personally: "Hey, you haven't used Kaiwa in 2 weeks. What's going on?"
- Offer help: "Is there a feature missing? A blocker we can fix?"
- If they ghost completely after 2 months → move them to "Alumni" status (still locked pricing, but no special access)

---

### Requested (Soft ask, not required)

**Both tiers**:
- 💬 Testimonial when they have a win
- 👥 Refer 1 friend (give them a referral bonus)
- 🧪 Beta test new features
- 📊 Feature voting/prioritization

**Don't force these**. But make it easy:

**Testimonial request template**:
```
Hey [Name]!

I saw you documented your conversation with [person] - congrats!

Would you be comfortable sharing a quick testimonial? Just:
• What were you worried about before?
• How did practicing help?
• How do you feel now?

Can be text, voice note, or short video - whatever's easiest.

No pressure if you're not comfortable!
```

**Referral incentive**:
```
Know someone else preparing for a high-stakes conversation?

Refer them and you BOTH get:
• 1 free month
• OR 1 extra 1-on-1 session

Just share this link: [your referral link]
```

---

## The Founder's Honest Pitch

**Use this when reaching out personally**:

```
Subject: Help me build Kaiwa (founding member spot)

Hey [Name],

You've been part of Kaiwa's journey [since Practice Lab / since you commented on Reddit / since you signed up for the guide].

I'm ready to launch with 10 founding members, and I want you to be one of them.

Here's the honest truth:

I don't have everything figured out yet.
Some features are rough.
Some things will break.
I'll need your patience and feedback.

But here's what I DO know:

You have a real conversation you need to prepare for.
You're taking this seriously.
And I want to help you succeed.

If you're willing to:
• Use Kaiwa 2x/week
• Give me honest feedback monthly
• Help me understand what works (and what doesn't)

Then I'll give you:
• Premium access for $14/month (normally $29)
• Locked at $14 FOREVER
• Personal 1-on-1 sessions with me monthly
• A direct line to influence what gets built

You're not just a customer. You're shaping what Kaiwa becomes.

Only 10 spots. You're getting this email because I think you'd be perfect for it.

Want in?

Reply "YES" and I'll send the payment link.

- [Your name]

P.S. If $14/month is tough right now, let me know. I'd rather have you as a founding member than lose you over price.
```

## FAQ for Yourself

### "What if I can't deliver on all the features I promise?"

**Answer**: You're not promising specific features. You're promising:
- Access to what exists now
- Early access to what you build
- A voice in what gets built

As long as you're transparent ("We're building X next based on your feedback"), you're good.

---

### "What if people abuse the lifetime lock?"

**Answer**:
- It's only 20 people max ($300-400/month "loss" vs $29/mo pricing)
- The feedback they give you is worth WAY more than $15/month
- If they're not engaged (don't use it), they naturally churn anyway
- The marketing value of "Original Founding Members" is priceless

---

### "Should I offer refunds?"

**Answer**:
- Yes, make it easy: "First month doesn't work out? Full refund, no questions asked."
- After Month 1: Standard monthly billing (they can cancel anytime)
- This removes risk for them and shows confidence in your product

---

### "What if I only get 5 founding members, not 10?"

**Answer**:
- 5 engaged users > 50 passive users
- Keep the spots open but raise urgency: "Only 5 spots left!"
- Adjust pricing later if needed (you can always add Product Advisor tier)

## Bottom Line: My Recommendation

### Launch with 2 tiers only:

**Tier 1: Founding Members** - $14/month (10 spots)
- Intensive engagement
- Monthly calls with you
- Lifetime lock

**Tier 2: Product Advisors** - $19/month (10 spots)
- Quarterly engagement
- Beta access
- Lifetime lock

**Don't launch Plus/Premium yet** - wait until Month 2 when you have:
- 20 engaged users validating features
- Clear differentiation between tiers
- Testimonials to show value

### Why this works:

1. **You get feedback** from 20 engaged users (not 100 passive ones)
2. **You validate pricing** (people WILL pay $14-19)
3. **You build loyalty** (lifetime locks create advocates)
4. **You keep it manageable** (20 people = you can give personal attention)
5. **You create urgency** (limited spots = FOMO)

### Your first email should go to:

1. Practice Lab attendees from Weeks 1-2
2. Reddit users who DM'd you
3. Email subscribers who engaged with your content

**Start with 5-10 personal emails, not a mass announcement.**
