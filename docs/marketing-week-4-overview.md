Kaiwa Beta Launch: Founding Member Offer

After 3 weeks of Practice Labs and working with 20+ people preparing for high-stakes conversations, I'm ready to launch Kaiwa Beta.

**What you get**:
• Unlimited practice scenarios (Meeting parents, apologies, difficult conversations, etc.)
• Weekly group Practice Labs (with feedback)
• 1 personalized 1-on-1 session per month
• Private WhatsApp group with direct founder access
• Lifetime founding member pricing (price locked forever)

**Founding Member Pricing**: $19/month

**The deal**:
I'm looking for 10 founding members who will:
• Use Kaiwa at least 2x per week
• Give me honest feedback monthly
• Share your wins (anonymously if you prefer)
• Help shape what Kaiwa becomes

**Why now**: You've been following the journey. You've seen it built in public. You know it works. This is your chance to lock in founding member pricing before it goes to $29/month.

Interested? DM me "FOUNDING" and let's talk.
```

**Afternoon** (90 min):

- Post beta announcement on LinkedIn
- Email your list with beta offer
- DM your top 10 engaged users personally

**Personal DM Template**:

```
Hey [Name],

You've been following the Kaiwa journey from [Week X]. Your [engagement/feedback/attendance] has been invaluable.

Founding member details:
• $19/month (locked forever)
• Unlimited practice
• Weekly Practice Labs
• 1 personal session per month
• Private WhatsApp group with direct access to me

In exchange: 2x/week usage + monthly feedback.

### WhatsApp Group Setup (Recommended)

   Quick logistics:
   • I'm adding you to our private WhatsApp group (10 founding members only)
   • We use it for quick feedback, sharing wins, and supporting each other

   What's your WhatsApp number?

   Also - when is your conversation happening? Want to make sure we're prepped!
   ```

   [Name] is preparing for [their specific situation]

   [Name], welcome! This group is your direct line to me + support from other founding members.
   Feel free to ask questions, share practice updates, or just lurk - whatever helps!

3 weeks ago, I hosted my first Practice Lab.

Today, I have 10 founding members.

Here's what they're saying:

---

"This 45-minute session was more valuable than 2 years of Duolingo for this specific conversation."
- Sarah, 29

---

"I've been so afraid of sounding stupid that I chose silence. Silence is worse. This helped me try."
- David, 35

---

"I just FELT the words instead of thinking about them. That's when I knew I could do this."
- Maria, 28

---

This is why I'm building Kaiwa.

Not for points or streaks.
For the moments that actually matter.

The conversations you're afraid of are the ones worth practicing.

Building in public, Day 25.

[If you're preparing for a high-stakes conversation, DM me "PREPARE" and let's talk.]

#buildinginpublic #testimonials #kaiwa
```

## Day 26: Referral System Launch

```
Founding Member Referral Program

For every friend you refer who becomes a founding member:
• You get: 1 extra 1-on-1 session (worth $49)
• They get: Founding member pricing + priority onboarding

How it works:
1. Share your unique referral link (I'll send you one)
2. When they sign up and mention you, you both get rewards
3. No limit on how many you can refer

Why this matters:
The best way to prepare for a high-stakes conversation? Practice with someone else preparing for the same thing.

Let's build this community together.
```

**Afternoon** (90 min):
