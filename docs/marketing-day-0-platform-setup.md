# Day 0: Platform Setup & Automation (Reddit + Instagram + TikTok)

**Do this BEFORE Day 1 to streamline everything**

**Time Required**: 2-3 hours one-time setup
**Goal**: Set up your 3 core platforms + automation tools so you can batch content and schedule ahead

---

## Why These 3 Platforms?

**Reddit**: Your ideal customers (Sofia) are actively searching for help here
**Instagram**: Visual storytelling + Reels for discovery
**TikTok**: Fastest organic reach for educational content

**NOT doing**: LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube (you can add later, but focus wins)

---

## Part 1: Account Setup (30 min)

### Reddit Setup

**Create accounts** (if you don't have them):
- Personal account (your main account)
- DO NOT create multiple accounts (against Reddit TOS)

**Join these subreddits**:
```
Essential (Japanese focus):
- r/LearnJapanese
- r/movingtojapan
- r/japanlife

Relationship focus:
- r/relationships
- r/relationship_advice
- r/LongDistance

Language learning:
- r/LanguageLearning
- r/bilingual
```

**Read the rules** of each subreddit:
- [ ] r/LearnJapanese - check self-promotion rules
- [ ] r/movingtojapan - check posting frequency limits
- [ ] r/relationships - check if you can mention external resources

**Create a simple Reddit bio**:
```
Building Kaiwa - helping people practice conversations they're afraid of (like meeting your partner's parents in their language).

Ask me anything about preparing for high-stakes language conversations.

Free Practice Labs every Saturday.
```

---

### Instagram Setup

**Create/optimize account**:

**Username**: `@trykaiwa` or `@kaiwa_app` or `@kaiwa.practice`

**Bio** (150 characters):
```

```

**Profile Setup**:

- Kaiwa website

**Content Prep**:
- [ ] Create 5 saved caption templates (more on this below)
- [ ] Create 5 saved hashtag groups (more on this below)

---

### TikTok Setup

**Create account**:

**Username**: `@trykaiwa` (match Instagram if possible)

**Bio** (80 characters):
```
Practice scary conversations 🗣️
Meeting partner's parents in their language?
Link 👇
```

**Profile Setup**:
- [ ] Profile picture: Same as Instagram
- [ ] Link: Same Linktree/Beacons link

**Settings to adjust**:
- [ ] Turn on comments
- [ ] Turn on duets/stitches (for engagement)
- [ ] Add "Business Account" (gives you analytics)

---

## Part 2: Automation Tools Setup (60 min)

### Option 1: Later (Recommended - Free Tier)

**Best for**: Instagram + TikTok scheduling + basic analytics

**Setup** (20 min):
1. Go to later.com
2. Sign up for free plan
3. Connect Instagram account (authorize)
4. Connect TikTok account (authorize)
5. Set your posting timezone

**Features you'll use**:
- Schedule Reels/TikToks 1 week ahead
- Auto-publish to Instagram (Reels may need manual approval)
- TikTok requires push notification to publish (Later reminds you)
- Visual calendar to see your content schedule
- Analytics on best times to post

**Free tier limits**: 10 posts per month per platform (enough for testing)

**Upgrade later**: $18/month for 30 posts/platform when you scale

---

### Option 2: Metricool (Alternative - Free Tier)

**Best for**: If you want Reddit post reminders + IG/TikTok scheduling

**Setup** (20 min):
1. Go to metricool.com
2. Sign up for free plan
3. Connect Instagram + TikTok
4. Add Reddit (manual reminders only - Reddit doesn't allow auto-posting)

**Features you'll use**:
- Schedule IG + TikTok
- Reddit "reminder" feature (tells you when to post, but you do it manually)
- Better analytics than Later
- Hashtag analyzer

**Free tier limits**: 1 social profile per platform

---

### Option 3: Publer (Budget Option)

**Best for**: If you want more control and customization

**Setup** (20 min):
1. Go to publer.io
2. Free plan: 3 social accounts, 10 posts/month
3. Connect Instagram + TikTok (save Reddit for manual posting)

**Features**:
- Schedule + auto-publish
- Preview exactly how posts will look
- Hashtag manager
- Best time to post suggestions

---

### My Recommendation: Start with Later

**Why**:
- Cleanest interface
- Instagram-focused (where you'll get best engagement)
- TikTok integration is solid
- Free tier is generous enough to test

**For Reddit**: Keep it manual (you WANT to be present and responsive anyway)

## Part 4: Batching Workflow Setup (30 min)

### Your Weekly Batching Schedule

Instead of creating content daily, batch it:

**Wednesday (2 hours) - Filming Day**:
- Film 5-7 TikToks/Reels at once (same outfit, same location)
- Use the same setup each time (faster)
- Film more than you need (you'll have backup)

**Thursday (1 hour) - Editing Day**:
- Edit all videos
- Add captions/text overlays
- Export in correct formats

**Friday (30 min) - Scheduling Day**:
- Upload to Later/Metricool
- Schedule for next week (Mon-Sun)
- Write captions using your templates
- Add hashtag groups

**Daily (15-30 min) - Reddit Engagement**:
- Find 1-2 relevant threads
- Leave thoughtful comments
- Respond to any replies from previous comments

**Saturday (2 hours) - Practice Lab**:
- Host session
- Film testimonials or recap

**This way you're CREATING once per week but POSTING every day.**

---

## Part 5: First Batch Creation (Today - 90 min)

Let's create your first week of content RIGHT NOW.

### Film 5 Videos (60 min)

Set up once:
- [ ] Find good lighting (near window)
- [ ] Neutral background
- [ ] Phone on tripod or stack of books
- [ ] Same outfit for all 5

**Film these 5 scripts** (10 min each):

**Video 1: Hook + 3 Phrases**
```
[Look at camera, conversational tone]

"If you're meeting your Japanese partner's parents tomorrow, here are the 3 phrases that matter most:

[Show on screen as you say them]

1. はじめまして、[name]と申します
   "Nice to meet you" (humble form)
   Shows respect ✓

2. いつも[partner]にお世話になっています
   "Thank you for raising [partner]"
   Shows gratitude ✓

3. まだ勉強中ですが、頑張ります
   "Still learning but doing my best"
   Shows humility ✓

You don't need perfect Japanese.
You need sincere Japanese.

```

**Video 2: What NOT to Say**
```
"3 things NOT to say when meeting your partner's parents:

❌ "日本語が上手" (My Japanese is good)
→ Sounds arrogant
✅ Instead: "まだ勉強中です"

❌ Over-apologizing every 5 seconds
→ Sounds insecure
✅ Instead: Use すみません once, thoughtfully

❌ "I don't understand" without trying
→ Sounds like you didn't prepare
✅ Instead: "もう一度お願いします"

They're watching HOW you try, not IF you're perfect.

```

**Video 3: Gift Tips**
```
"The gift (お土産) matters more than your Japanese level.

Here's what to bring:

✅ Something from YOUR hometown
   (Shows thoughtfulness)

✅ Something they can share
   (Tea, cookies, local snack)

✅ Wrapped nicely
   (Presentation = respect)

❌ Avoid: Alcohol (unless you know they drink)
❌ Avoid: Super expensive (creates obligation)
❌ Avoid: Nothing (big miss)

The gift is your opening move.

Want more tips? Link in bio 👆"
```

**Video 4: Handling "I Don't Understand"**
```
"What to do when you completely freeze mid-conversation:

1. Don't panic (they expect you to struggle sometimes)

2. Use: "もう一度お願いします"
   ("Could you say that again?")

3. If still confused: "ゆっくり話していただけますか"
   ("Could you speak slower?")

4. Nuclear option: Smile + "日本語がまだ難しいです"
   ("Japanese is still hard for me")

Then: Your partner can help translate

It's okay to not understand everything.
What matters is that you TRIED.

Practice this with us Saturday - link in bio 👆"
```

**Video 5: Biggest Mistake**
```
"The biggest mistake people make?

Treating it like a grammar test.

Your partner's parents aren't judging your:
❌ Verb conjugation
❌ Particle usage
❌ Accent

They're judging your:
✅ Sincerity
✅ Effort
✅ Respect for their family

Perfect grammar with no heart = cold
Broken Japanese with genuine warmth = connection

Which do you think matters more?

```

**Film all 5 back-to-back.** Don't overthink it. Multiple takes are fine.

---

## Part 6: Reddit Strategy (Manual, Not Automated)

Reddit CANNOT and SHOULD NOT be automated. Here's why:
- Auto-posting = instant ban
- Reddit rewards genuine engagement
- Your customers are ACTIVELY asking for help

**Instead: Daily Reddit Ritual** (20 min/day)

### Morning Routine (10 min):
1. Check your saved subreddits
2. Sort by "New" (catch threads early)
3. Find 1-2 threads where someone asks about:
   - Meeting partner's parents
   - Language anxiety
   - Preparing for important conversation
4. Bookmark them

### Evening Routine (10 min):
1. Write thoughtful 200-300 word responses
2. Use your templates (from Day 1-7 plans)
3. Post
4. Check back next day to respond to replies

**Goal**: 1-2 high-value comments per day, not 10 spammy ones.

---

## Part 7: Platform-Specific Best Practices

### Instagram Reels

**Best times to post** (test these):
- Mon-Fri: 6-9am, 12-2pm, 7-9pm
- Sat-Sun: 10am-12pm

**Hashtags**: 5-10 relevant (don't stuff 30)

**First 3 seconds**: Hook or they'll scroll
- "POV: Meeting partner's parents tomorrow..."
- "3 things NOT to say when..."
- "The mistake everyone makes..."

**Captions**:
- First line must hook (shows in feed)
- Use line breaks for readability
- End with question (drives comments)

**Engagement hack**:
- Respond to EVERY comment in first hour
- Ask questions back
- Pin best comments

---

### TikTok

**Best times to post** (test these):
- 6-9am, 11am-1pm, 7-11pm (when people scroll)

**Hashtags**: 3-5 max
- 1 big hashtag (#languagelearning - 1M+ views)
- 2 medium (#learnJapanese - 100K views)
- 2 niche (#meetingtheparents - 10K views)

**Algorithm tips**:
- First 3 hours = critical (engage with everyone)
- Reply to comments with videos (boosts engagement)
- Watch time matters (hook in 2 seconds)
- Post 1x per day minimum for algorithm love

**Pinned Comment**:
Always pin this comment first:

---

### Reddit

**Best times to post**:
- 7-9am EST (catch morning browsers)
- 12-2pm EST (lunch scroll)
- 8-11pm EST (evening scroll)

**Comment strategy**:
- Be FIRST (sort by New)
- Be HELPFUL (don't pitch)
- Be SPECIFIC (give exact phrases, not vague advice)

**Karma building**:
- Give more than you take (10:1 ratio helpful:promotional)
- Crosspost carefully (read rules first)
- Never link to Kaiwa in original post (only if asked)

**Red flags to avoid**:
- Multiple posts in same day = spam
- Same comment copy-pasted = ban
- Link-dropping without value = downvoted

---
