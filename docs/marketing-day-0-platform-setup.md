# Day 0: Platform Setup & Automation (Reddit + Instagram + TikTok)

**Do this BEFORE Day 1 to streamline everything**

**Time Required**: 2-3 hours one-time setup
**Goal**: Set up your 3 core platforms + automation tools so you can batch content and schedule ahead

---

## Why These 3 Platforms?

**Reddit**: Your ideal customers (Sofia) are actively searching for help here
**Instagram**: Visual storytelling + Reels for discovery
**TikTok**: Fastest organic reach for educational content

**NOT doing**: LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube (you can add later, but focus wins)

---

## Part 1: Account Setup (30 min)

### Reddit Setup

**Create accounts** (if you don't have them):

- Personal account (your main account)
- DO NOT create multiple accounts (against Reddit TOS)

**Join these subreddits**:

```
Essential (Japanese focus):
- r/LearnJapanese
- r/movingtojapan
- r/japanlife

Relationship focus:
- r/relationships
- r/relationship_advice
- r/LongDistance

Language learning:
- r/LanguageLearning
- r/bilingual
```

**Read the rules** of each subreddit:

- [ ] r/LearnJapanese - check self-promotion rules
- [ ] r/movingtojapan - check posting frequency limits
- [ ] r/relationships - check if you can mention external resources

**Create a simple Reddit bio**:

```
Building Kaiwa - helping people practice conversations they're afraid of (like meeting your partner's parents in their language).

Ask me anything about preparing for high-stakes language conversations.

Free Practice Labs every Saturday.
```

---

### Instagram Setup

**Create/optimize account**:

**Username**: `@trykaiwa` or `@kaiwa_app` or `@kaiwa.practice`

**Bio** (150 characters):

```
Practice the conversations you're afraid of 🗣️
Meeting partner's parents? We got you.
Free Practice Lab every Saturday 👇
[Link]
```

**Profile Setup**:

- [ ] Profile picture: Kaiwa logo or simple brand color
- [ ] Highlights: Create 3-4 highlights
  - "About" - What is Kaiwa

**Content Prep**:

- [ ] Create 5 saved caption templates (more on this below)
- [ ] Create 5 saved hashtag groups (more on this below)

---

### TikTok Setup

**Create account**:

**Username**: `@trykaiwa` (match Instagram if possible)

**Bio** (80 characters):

```
Practice scary conversations 🗣️
Meeting partner's parents in their language?
Link 👇
```

**Profile Setup**:

- [ ] Profile picture: Same as Instagram
- [ ] Link: Same Linktree/Beacons link

**Settings to adjust**:

- [ ] Turn on comments
- [ ] Turn on duets/stitches (for engagement)
- [ ] Add "Business Account" (gives you analytics)

---

## Part 2: Automation Tools Setup (60 min)

### Option 1: Later (Recommended - Free Tier)

**Best for**: Instagram + TikTok scheduling + basic analytics

**Setup** (20 min):

1. Go to later.com
2. Sign up for free plan
3. Connect Instagram account (authorize)
4. Connect TikTok account (authorize)
5. Set your posting timezone

**Features you'll use**:

- Schedule Reels/TikToks 1 week ahead
- Auto-publish to Instagram (Reels may need manual approval)
- TikTok requires push notification to publish (Later reminds you)
- Visual calendar to see your content schedule
- Analytics on best times to post

**Free tier limits**: 10 posts per month per platform (enough for testing)

**Upgrade later**: $18/month for 30 posts/platform when you scale

---

### Option 2: Metricool (Alternative - Free Tier)

**Best for**: If you want Reddit post reminders + IG/TikTok scheduling

**Setup** (20 min):

1. Go to metricool.com
2. Sign up for free plan
3. Connect Instagram + TikTok
4. Add Reddit (manual reminders only - Reddit doesn't allow auto-posting)

**Features you'll use**:

- Schedule IG + TikTok
- Reddit "reminder" feature (tells you when to post, but you do it manually)
- Better analytics than Later
- Hashtag analyzer

**Free tier limits**: 1 social profile per platform

---

### Option 3: Publer (Budget Option)

**Best for**: If you want more control and customization

**Setup** (20 min):

1. Go to publer.io
2. Free plan: 3 social accounts, 10 posts/month
3. Connect Instagram + TikTok (save Reddit for manual posting)

**Features**:

- Schedule + auto-publish
- Preview exactly how posts will look
- Hashtag manager
- Best time to post suggestions

---

### My Recommendation: Start with Later

**Why**:

- Cleanest interface
- Instagram-focused (where you'll get best engagement)
- TikTok integration is solid
- Free tier is generous enough to test

**For Reddit**: Keep it manual (you WANT to be present and responsive anyway)

## Part 4: Batching Workflow Setup (30 min)

### Your Weekly Batching Schedule

Instead of creating content daily, batch it:

**Wednesday (2 hours) - Filming Day**:

- Film 5-7 TikToks/Reels at once (same outfit, same location)
- Use the same setup each time (faster)
- Film more than you need (you'll have backup)

**Thursday (1 hour) - Editing Day**:

- Edit all videos
- Add captions/text overlays
- Export in correct formats

**Friday (30 min) - Scheduling Day**:

- Upload to Later/Metricool
- Schedule for next week (Mon-Sun)
- Write captions using your templates
- Add hashtag groups

**Daily (15-30 min) - Reddit Engagement**:

- Find 1-2 relevant threads
- Leave thoughtful comments
- Respond to any replies from previous comments

**Saturday (2 hours) - Practice Lab**:

- Host session
- Film testimonials or recap

**This way you're CREATING once per week but POSTING every day.**

---

## Part 5: First Batch Creation (Today - 90 min)

Let's create your first week of content RIGHT NOW.

### Film 5 Videos (60 min)

Set up once:

- [ ] Find good lighting (near window)
- [ ] Neutral background
- [ ] Phone on tripod or stack of books
- [ ] Same outfit for all 5

**Film these 5 videos** (30-45 seconds each):

> **NEW APPROACH (Based on proven strategy):** Simple walking videos with AI voiceover or text overlay. No need to speak to camera. Just authentic footage of you walking in Japan with text/voiceover about your app.
>
> **Why this works:** Cali's best performing creative was "just like a f**\*\*** half second reel of me or Sunny walking down the street saying like my life changed when I started talking to my AI therapist with like Bad Bunny's song over it."

**Setup:**

- Walk in an interesting location in Japan (street, park, train station)
- Film yourself from behind or side angle (authentic, not staged)
- Add text overlay OR AI voiceover
- Use trending/popular music in background
- Keep it 30-45 seconds max

---

**Video 1: The Core Problem**

```
[Walking footage: You walking down a Tokyo street]

TEXT OVERLAY or AI VOICEOVER:
"My life changed when I started practicing real conversations

Not textbook Japanese

The kind you need when meeting your girlfriend's parents for the first time

And you're terrified

Because you know they're judging whether you're good enough

But you can barely say 'nice to meet you' without sweating

Kaiwa helps you practice those moments

Free practice lab this Saturday"
```

Music: Something moody/emotional (trending sound)

---

**Video 2: The Relatable Moment**

```
[Walking footage: You walking through Shibuya crossing or busy area]

TEXT OVERLAY or AI VOICEOVER:
"That moment when your partner becomes your translator

And the conversation stops being yours

You just sit there

Nodding

Smiling

But completely disconnected

Love shouldn't need subtitles

Practice the conversations that matter

Link in bio"
```

Music: Something that builds tension

---

**Video 3: The Transformation**

```
[Walking footage: You walking in a quieter neighborhood]

TEXT OVERLAY or AI VOICEOVER:
"Started using Kaiwa 2 weeks ago

Today I apologized to my girlfriend in Japanese

Actually apologized

Not Google Translate

Not asking her to translate

My words

She cried

The good kind

This is what I built it for"
```

Music: Emotional/uplifting

---

**Video 4: The Reality**

```
[Walking footage: You walking past a restaurant or family setting]

TEXT OVERLAY or AI VOICEOVER:
"You don't need perfect Japanese

You need sincere Japanese

The kind where they know you tried

Where effort matters more than grammar

Where showing up matters more than fluency

Kaiwa: practice the moments that matter

Saturday free practice lab"
```

Music: Chill/authentic vibe

---

**Video 5: The Invitation**

```
[Walking footage: You walking toward camera then past it]

TEXT OVERLAY or AI VOICEOVER:
"Building Kaiwa for people who are tired of subtitles

Tired of translation apps

Tired of their partner being the interpreter

If you need to have ONE conversation that matters

Meeting parents. Apologizing. Sharing news.

We practice that

Not 'the cat is on the table'

Real life

Join us Saturday - link in bio"
```

Music: Confident/inviting

---

**Filming tips:**

- Film all 5 in ONE session (30-45 min total)
- Just walk naturally - no need to perform
- Get 2-3 takes of each location
- Film in 9:16 vertical format
- Don't worry about perfect framing - authenticity > production value

---

### Quick Edit (30 min)

Use CapCut (free, easy) - **Two options:**

**Option A: Text Overlay (Easier)**

1. Import walking footage
2. Trim to 30-45 seconds (keep most engaging part)
3. Add trending music from CapCut library
4. Add text overlay - one line at a time, synced to music beats
5. Use large, readable font (white text with black outline works best)
6. Export in 9:16 format

**Option B: AI Voiceover (More engaging)**

1. Import walking footage
2. Trim to 30-45 seconds
3. Add text-to-speech (CapCut has AI voices): Tap "Text" → "Text to speech"
4. Paste your script, choose natural-sounding voice
5. Add subtle background music (lower volume than voice)
6. Optional: Add text captions for accessibility
7. Export in 9:16 format

**Pro tip:** Test both styles. Justin said their best performer was simple with music. Start with text overlay + music, try AI voiceover later.

Do this for all 5 videos.

---

### Schedule in Later (15 min)

1. Log into Later
2. Upload all 5 videos
3. Schedule:
   - Video 1: Monday 10am
   - Video 2: Tuesday 2pm
   - Video 3: Wednesday 6pm
   - Video 4: Thursday 10am
   - Video 5: Friday 2pm

4. Add captions (use your templates)
5. Add hashtags (use your groups)
6. Set to post to both Instagram Reels + TikTok

**Done! You have a week of content scheduled.**

---

## Part 6: Reddit Strategy (Manual, Not Automated)

Reddit CANNOT and SHOULD NOT be automated. Here's why:

- Auto-posting = instant ban
- Reddit rewards genuine engagement
- Your customers are ACTIVELY asking for help

**Instead: Daily Reddit Ritual** (20 min/day)

### Morning Routine (10 min):

1. Check your saved subreddits
2. Sort by "New" (catch threads early)
3. Find 1-2 threads where someone asks about:
   - Meeting partner's parents
   - Language anxiety
   - Preparing for important conversation
4. Bookmark them

### Evening Routine (10 min):

1. Write thoughtful 200-300 word responses
2. Use your templates (from Day 1-7 plans)
3. Post
4. Check back next day to respond to replies

**Goal**: 1-2 high-value comments per day, not 10 spammy ones.

---

## Part 7: Platform-Specific Best Practices

### Instagram Reels

**Best times to post** (test these):

- Mon-Fri: 6-9am, 12-2pm, 7-9pm
- Sat-Sun: 10am-12pm

**Hashtags**: 5-10 relevant (don't stuff 30)

**First 3 seconds**: Hook or they'll scroll

- "POV: Meeting partner's parents tomorrow..."
- "3 things NOT to say when..."
- "The mistake everyone makes..."

**Captions**:

- First line must hook (shows in feed)
- Use line breaks for readability
- End with question (drives comments)

**Engagement hack**:

- Respond to EVERY comment in first hour
- Ask questions back
- Pin best comments

---

### TikTok

**Best times to post** (test these):

- 6-9am, 11am-1pm, 7-11pm (when people scroll)

**Hashtags**: 3-5 max

- 1 big hashtag (#languagelearning - 1M+ views)
- 2 medium (#learnJapanese - 100K views)
- 2 niche (#meetingtheparents - 10K views)

**Algorithm tips**:

- First 3 hours = critical (engage with everyone)
- Reply to comments with videos (boosts engagement)
- Watch time matters (hook in 2 seconds)
- Post 1x per day minimum for algorithm love

**Pinned Comment**:
Always pin this comment first:

```

```

---

### Reddit

**Best times to post**:

- 7-9am EST (catch morning browsers)
- 12-2pm EST (lunch scroll)
- 8-11pm EST (evening scroll)

**Comment strategy**:

- Be FIRST (sort by New)
- Be HELPFUL (don't pitch)
- Be SPECIFIC (give exact phrases, not vague advice)

**Karma building**:

- Give more than you take (10:1 ratio helpful:promotional)
- Crosspost carefully (read rules first)
- Never link to Kaiwa in original post (only if asked)

**Red flags to avoid**:

- Multiple posts in same day = spam
- Same comment copy-pasted = ban
- Link-dropping without value = downvoted

---
