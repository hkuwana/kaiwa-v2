# Kaiwa User Feedback Triage

**Last Updated**: November 10, 2025
**Total Sessions**: 10+ (Scott, Mark, akuwana3, Timothy, Kazu, Brie, Martin, Thomas Clarke, Austrian User, Dad)

**North Star**: Give users the specific, practiced skills to have a single, successful, high-stakes conversation with a loved one.

**Primary Persona**: Sofia (Bilingual Spouse) | Secondary: David (Heritage Speaker) | Tertiary: Jamie (Relocation Expat)

---

## 🎯 Design Principle: "Does This Serve The Magic Moment?"

**The Magic Moment**: When Sofia finishes practicing "Meeting partner's family" and thinks: _"I can actually do this."_

Every issue below is evaluated through this lens:

- **🔴 Critical** = Breaks the magic moment entirely
- **🟡 High** = Blocks users from reaching the magic moment
- **🟠 Medium** = Dilutes the magic moment
- **⚪ Low** = Polish that doesn't affect core experience

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Breaks The Magic Moment

### 1. AI Responds to Itself (Conversation Killer)

**NEW** 🚨 **SHOWSTOPPER**

- **Mentions**: 3 (Thomas Clarke, Martin implied with "three responses", **Justin Kim confirmed**)
- **Why Critical**: If Lily talks to herself, the entire illusion collapses. User can't practice. Session dead.
- **Impact**: ~2% of conversations become unusable (Justin confirmed this exact number during demo)
- **User Quote**: "Responded to itself so conversation couldn't continue" (Thomas Clarke)
- **Justin's Reaction**: "This glitch needs fixing" (during live demo)
- **Fix Priority**: **TODAY**
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Root Cause**: Likely audio stream not closed properly or agent thinking user responded when they didn't.

---

### 2. Agent Verbosity (The Interview Problem)

- **Mentions**: 5+ (Timothy, Martin, akuwana3, Thomas Clarke, Mark)
- **Why Critical**: If agent dominates, user never speaks → no practice → no confidence gained
- **User Quotes**:
  - "Talking too long, verbosity of length of turns" (Thomas Clarke)
  - "Text still pretty long, needs to be less verbose" (Martin)
  - "Agent spazzes out with multiple responses" (Martin)
  - "Three different responses going on instead of one" (Martin)
- **Design Insight**: Real conversations = 50/50 speaking time. Agent should speak LESS than user, not more.
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**:

- Hard limit: 2-3 sentences max per agent turn
- If beginner responds with 5 words, agent responds with 7-10 words (not 50)
- NEVER send 3 responses in one turn

---

### 3. No Natural Speech Patterns (Uncanny Valley)

**NEW** 🎨 **HUMAN TOUCH**

- **Mentions**: 1 (Thomas Clarke)
- **Why Critical**: Without "uhms" and "uhhs," Lily doesn't sound human → breaks belief that this prepares you for real people
- **User Quote**: "No uhms or uhhs" (Thomas Clarke)
- **Design Insight**: Perfection is inhuman. Real people hesitate. Lily should too.
- [x] **Status**: ✅ Completed (November 16, 2025)

**Fix**: Add natural disfluencies based on conversation context:

- "Hmm, that's interesting..."
- "Oh, let me think..."
- "Uh, well..."

---

### 4. Scenario Drift (Generic Questions Kill Specificity)

- **Mentions**: 3 (Martin, Timothy, Mark)
- **Why Critical**: If user came to practice "ordering food" but agent asks "what's your favorite book," they didn't practice what they came for
- **User Quote**: "Glitch where role-play goes back to analysis of previous conversation" (Martin)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**: System prompt must LOCK IN scenario context. Every turn should reference the scenario.

---

### 5. Lost Scenario When Switching Language

**NEW** ⚠️ **FLOW KILLER**

- **Mentions**: 2 (Martin, general persistence issues)
- **Why Critical**: User picks scenario → switches language → scenario disappears = broken flow, have to start over
- **User Quotes**:
  - "Switched out of scenario when it was role-play; lost scenario when language switched" (Martin)
  - "Spanish came up after pressing Russian" (Martin)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**: Scenario + Language should be locked together once selected. Don't reset on language change.

---

### 6. Analysis Page Freezes on Mobile

**NEW** 📱 **PROOF MOMENT BROKEN**

- **Mentions**: 1 (Austrian user)
- **Why Critical**: Analysis = proof user improved. If it freezes, user never gets validation → no belief in progress
- **User Quote**: "Problem with analysis page on mobile where it freezes"
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**: Debug mobile-specific issue. This is the "you got better" moment.

---

### 7. Push-to-Talk Hidden/Confusing

- **Mentions**: 3 (Scott, Timothy, Martin)
- **Why Critical**: If user doesn't know HOW to speak, they can't practice at all
- **User Quotes**:
  - "Press and hold to talk should go above audio visualizer instead of below" (Martin)
  - "Push to talk isn't intuitive since it doesn't show" (Timothy)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Design Fix**: Primary action = most obvious element. Make it HUGE and BEAUTIFUL.

---

### 8. AI Persona Too Formal (Immersion Killer)

**NEW** 💬 **JUSTIN KIM INSIGHT**

- **Mentions**: 1 (Justin Kim during demo)
- **Why Critical**: If AI feels robotic/formal, users don't connect emotionally → no relationship with Lily → lower conversion
- **User Quote**: "The AI persona is a little bit too formal" (Justin Kim, Nov 10)
- **Fix Priority**: **THIS WEEK**
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**:

- Make persona more flirtatious and fun (especially for relationship scenarios)
- Default to deeper, raspy male voice for dating/relationship contexts
- Less professional, more personality
- Consider different personas for different scenario types

---

## 🟡 HIGH: Blocks Path to Magic Moment

### 9. Paid Conversion Not Working (1% → Need 8-10%)

**NEW** 💰 **MONETIZATION BLOCKER**

- **Mentions**: 3 (Martin dad feedback, Justin's advice, Hiro's own data)
- **Why High**: Can't fund development if users won't pay
- **User Quotes**:
  - "Dad's feedback: paid conversion isn't that good" (Martin)
  - "Paid conversion rate currently 1%" (Hiro to Justin, Nov 10)
- **Justin's Strategic Insights**:
  - Analysis feature needs to be "beefed up" to be payworthy
  - Product must prioritize immersiveness (image backgrounds, character personality)
  - Make Lily more memorable with Ghibli-style avatars
  - Consider native app for better stickiness
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Hypothesis**: Users don't believe they improved enough to justify $15/month

**Fix**: Make the value OBVIOUS:

- Show clear before/after improvement
- Make Lily memorable (Ghibli art, personality) ← **Justin confirmed this priority**
- Add conversation continuity (relationship with Lily)
- Add immersive image backgrounds that change based on conversation
- Make AI persona less formal, more engaging

---

### 9. Transcript Shown by Default (Reading > Speaking Trap)

**NEW** 🎨 **DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**

- **Mentions**: Multiple (Thomas Clarke, Brie falls back on transcript, Austrian user feedback)
- **Why High**: Every pixel of text = pixel away from listening practice
- **User Quotes**:
  - "Advanced users find transcript distracting while speaking" (Austrian)
  - "Falls back on transcript instead of listening practice" (Brie)
  - "Hide show transcript under conversation mode active" (Martin)
- [x] **Status**: ✅ Completed (November 16, 2025)

**Jony Ive Fix**: DEFAULT = no transcript. Add tiny "show text" button for anxious beginners.

---

### 10. Overwhelming Language/Scenario Selection

- **Mentions**: 2 (Timothy, implied by conversion issues)
- **Why High**: 40 scenarios + 8 languages = analysis paralysis → users bounce before trying
- **User Quote**: "Finding languages is a lot since there's quite a bit showing" (Timothy)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Steve Jobs Fix**: Start with ONE question:

- "What conversation are you dreading?"
- Three buttons: Family | Partner | Work
- Done. Pick language second.

---

### 11. No Conversation Continuity (No Relationship with Lily)

- **Mentions**: 2 (Brie, Scott memory loss)
- **Why High**: Users want to practice with same partner repeatedly. Starting fresh every time = cognitive load + transactional feel
- **User Quote**: "Wants to continue previous conversations with Lily; would pay for feature" (Brie)
- **Monetization Signal**: Brie said she'd PAY for this
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**: "Continue with Lily" button. Persistent memory. Lily remembers you.

---

### 12. Audio Instructions for Different Browsers

**NEW** 🔧 **ACTIVATION BLOCKER**

- **Mentions**: 1 (Martin)
- **Why High**: If user can't figure out how to enable audio, they can't use the app at all
- **User Quote**: "Show better instructions for turning on audio for different browsers" (Martin)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**: Browser-specific onboarding modals (Safari vs Chrome vs Firefox)

---

### 13. Menu UX Issues (Hamburger Icon, Doesn't Close)

**NEW** 🎨 **IVE HATED HAMBURGERS**

- **Mentions**: 2 (Scott, Martin)
- **Why High**: Hidden navigation = hidden features = users miss value
- **User Quotes**:
  - "Show options menu more prominently instead of hamburger icon" (Martin)
  - "Menu doesn't close when touched outside" (Scott)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Jony Ive Fix**: Kill the hamburger. 3 big beautiful buttons for core actions.

---

## 🟠 MEDIUM: Dilutes Magic Moment

### 14. Confusing Scenario Names

**NEW** 📝 **CLARITY**

- **Mentions**: 1 (Martin)
- **Why Medium**: "Midnight pain triage visit" → user thinks "what?" Naming matters.
- **User Quote**: "Midnight pain triage visit is confusing (maybe Doctor's visit)" (Martin)
- [x] **Status**: ✅ Completed (November 16, 2025)

**Fix**: Rename to human-understandable labels: "Emergency Room Visit"

---

### 15. Calm Mode vs Conversation Mode Confusion

**NEW** 🤔 **MODE COMPLEXITY**

- **Mentions**: 2 (Scott, Martin)
- **Why Medium**: Why are there modes? Just adapt UI based on what's happening.
- **User Quote**: "Maybe make calm mode default and have show transcript on the side" (Martin)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**: Remove "modes" concept. Just have one flow that adapts.

---

### 16. Scenario Dots Don't Navigate Back

**NEW** 🧭 **PROGRESS INDICATOR**

- **Mentions**: 1 (Martin)
- **Why Medium**: If user sees progress dots, they should be tappable to go back
- **User Quote**: "Make dots of scenario lead you back" (Martin)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**: Make dots interactive breadcrumb navigation.

---

### 17. Create Scenario Feature Buggy

- **Mentions**: 2 (Martin, Timothy)
- **Why Medium**: Custom scenarios = personalization, but not core to first experience
- [ ] **Status**: Open

---

### 18. Analysis Depth (Monetization Feature)

- **Mentions**: 3 (Martin, Timothy, Brie)
- **Why Medium**: Analysis exists and works, but needs depth for premium tier justification
- **User Quote**: "Found analysis good but needs to be 'beefed up' to be payworthy" (Martin)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

**Fix**: Add vocabulary alternatives, pronunciation feedback, grammar depth

---

### 19. Screen Size/Scrolling Issues

**NEW** 📱 **MOBILE POLISH**

- **Mentions**: 1 (Thomas Clarke)
- **Why Medium**: UI polish issue, not blocker
- **User Quote**: "Screen seems to be larger than screen in conversationMode Active when it should not be scrollable"
- [ ] **Status**: Open

---

### 20. No Audio Playback/Slow Down

- **Mentions**: 2 (Timothy, Brie)
- **Why Medium**: Nice to have for learning, but not core to first magic moment
- **User Quote**: "Can't replay AI speech or slow down" (Brie)
- [ ] **Status**: Open

---

## ⚪ LOW: Polish (Don't Do Until PMF)

### Dialect Support

- Austrian German, Swiss German (Austrian user)
- Egyptian Arabic, Moroccan Arabic (Martin)
- Colombian vs Spain Spanish (Martin)
- [ ] **Status**: Backlog (do AFTER core magic works)

### Language-Specific Issues

- Portuguese too easy (Mark)
- Taiwan flag wrong (Timothy)
- Chinese pinyin (partially fixed)

### UI Polish

- Stars system confusing (Scott)
- Hover functionality (Timothy)
- Scenario difficulty legend (Martin)
- "Start new conversation" navigation (Timothy)

---

## 💚 What's Working (DO NOT BREAK)

- ✅ **Voice quality very clear** (Martin)
- ✅ **Pace/speed of speech really good** (Martin)
- ✅ **"Dynamism vs busy work"** (Timothy) ← This is your soul
- ✅ **Dialogue mode most liked** (Timothy)
- ✅ **Lily as conversation partner** (Brie) ← This is your moat
- ✅ **Agent intelligence; doesn't hallucinate** (Martin)

---

## 🎯 This Week's Ruthless Priorities

### Must Fix (Breaks Magic)

1. **AI responding to itself** - Debug TODAY
2. **Agent verbosity** - Hard limit 2-3 sentences
3. **Natural speech patterns** - Add "uhms" and hesitations
4. **Analysis freezing on mobile** - Test and fix

### Should Fix (Blocks Conversion)

5. **Transcript default OFF** - Hide by default, show button
6. **Scenario + Language persistence** - Lock together
7. **Push-to-talk positioning** - Make it OBVIOUS

### Test & Learn (Conversion Hypothesis)

8. **Simplify first screen** - One question: "What conversation are you dreading?"
9. **Make Lily memorable** - Add Ghibli-style avatar - ✅ IN PROGRESS
10. **"Continue with Lily" button** - Test if continuity increases retention

---

## 📊 Key Metrics to Track

1. **Magic Moment Completion Rate**: % of users who finish first scenario
2. **Conversation Quality**: Average speaking time (user vs agent)
3. **Return Rate**: % who come back next day
4. **Conversion Rate**: 1% → 8-10% target
5. **"Lily Love"**: % who mention AI partner by name in feedback

---

## 💭 Strategic Questions to Answer

### Billing Metric Decision

- **Current**: Minutes spoken
- **Proposed**: Words spoken (or hybrid)
- **User Insight**: "People prefer evaluating based on how much THEY talk" (Thomas Clarke)
- **Recommendation**: Test "words YOU spoke" vs "minutes of practice"

### First Page Simplification

- **Current**: Full landing page with features
- **Proposed**: Move to about page, simplify entry
- **Recommendation**: A/B test minimal entry point vs full explainer

### Native App Timing

- **Justin's Advice**: Eventually, but not now
- **Your Instinct**: After PMF or fundraising
- **Recommendation**: Improve PWA first (push notifications, home screen presence)

---

## 📝 Individual User Snapshot Updates

### Austrian User (NEW)

**Language**: German
**Key Insight**: Real-world immersion (3 weeks in Germany) taught more than app
**Implication**: App should feel like immersion, not lessons

### Thomas Clarke (NEW)

**Status**: Active tester

Before building any feature, ask:

1. **Does this serve the magic moment?** (Sofia feeling "I can do this")
2. **Does this make Lily more memorable?** (Your moat)

## 💡 Justin Kim Strategic Consultation (November 10, 2025)

**Context**: Justin Kim (medical student, founder of Cali eating disorder app) reviewed Kaiwa and provided distribution/product strategy advice.

### 🚨 Critical Strategic Pivots

#### **DISTRIBUTION: TikTok/Instagram > Reddit** ⚠️ CONTRADICTS CURRENT STRATEGY

**Justin's Recommendation:**

- ❌ **DON'T use Reddit** - "Low-yield, too anonymized for effective user engagement"
- ✅ **DO use TikTok and Instagram** - Low-quality UGC style ads
- ✅ **Hiro should be the face** - "You're a good-looking dude, use yourself in content"
- ✅ **Put ad money behind high-performing creative**

**Current Strategy Conflict:**

- DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY.md says: "Reddit (70% of effort), SKIP Instagram/TikTok for 90 days"
- **Decision needed**: Test Justin's TikTok-first approach vs Reddit-first approach

**UGC Creative Strategy:**

- Make ads look low-quality/authentic (NOT polished)
- Simple video: Hiro + girlfriend discussing long-distance language barrier
- Highlight problem: "What if they think I'm stupid?"
- Example: Simple walking video talking about AI conversation practice

#### **PHONE NUMBER SIGN-UPS (CRITICAL)**

**Justin's Requirement:**

- ✅ **Implement phone number sign-ups** (not just Gmail)
- Why: "People rarely respond to email outreach, but they respond to texts"
- Personal text messaging to new users for feedback
- Convert engaged users to "product advisors" with lifetime free access
- Use WhatsApp group for community (Discord for younger users only)

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Add phone number field to sign-up flow
- [ ] Set up US phone number (via messaging service) for Hiro in Japan
- [ ] Create text messaging outreach script
- [ ] Set up product advisor program (lifetime free access incentive)

#### **TRACKING & ANALYTICS**

**Justin's Requirements:**

- [ ] Install Pixel in web app code (Meta or TikTok business account)
- [ ] Track signups from ads to measure performance
- [ ] A/B test creative content performance

#### **TARGET MARKET FOCUS**

**Justin's Insight:**

- **Primary target**: Women learning Korean or Japanese for relationships
- **Secondary**: Men will pay, but women are more active/consistent users
- **Beach head**: Women interested in K-pop, anime, or dating Korean/Japanese men
- This is a "strong beach head" for initial traction

### 🎨 Product Immersiveness Recommendations

#### **1. Ghibli-Style Character Avatars** ✅ CONFIRMED PRIORITY

**Justin's Feedback:**

- Make characters cute, Ghibli-style animated
- Give each character distinct personality
- This differentiates from generic competitors like Pingo.AI (which "lacks personality")

**Action Items:**

- [x] Add to priority list (already in progress)
- [ ] Generate AI prototypes (Midjourney)
- [ ] Integrate into MessageBubble component

#### **2. Image Backgrounds for Scenarios**

**Justin's Suggestion:**

- Add image backgrounds that change based on conversation context
- Makes experience more immersive
- Helps users feel "transported" to the scenario

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Design background system (per scenario or dynamic)
- [ ] Source/generate background images
- [ ] Implement background rendering in conversation UI

#### **3. AI Persona Adjustment**

**Justin's Feedback:**

- Current persona "a little bit too formal"
- Make it more flirtatious and fun (for relationship scenarios)
- Default to deeper, raspy male voice for relationship contexts
- Less professional, more engaging personality

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Update system prompts for relationship scenarios
- [ ] Test different voice options (OpenAI voice IDs)
- [ ] A/B test formal vs casual persona

#### **4. Kdrama-Inspired Roleplay Scenarios**

**Justin's Idea:**

- Create scenarios based on iconic Kdrama scenes
- Leverage cultural moments that target market already loves
- Makes practice feel less like "homework," more like fan engagement

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Research popular Kdrama moments
- [ ] Create 3-5 Kdrama-inspired scenarios
- [ ] Test with Korean language learners

### 📱 Native App Priority

**Justin's Strong Recommendation:**

- Make Kaiwa into native app "as soon as possible"
- Better user stickiness than web app
- Improved UX and engagement
- Timeline: Consider starting next month after TikTok marketing

**Action Items:**

- [ ] Evaluate React Native vs Swift
- [ ] Timeline: Q1 2026 or after reaching $X MRR
- [ ] Focus on iOS first (target market primarily iPhone users)

### 📊 Marketing Execution Plan (Per Justin)

**Weekly Commitment:**

- [ ] Create TikTok/Instagram Reel creative featuring Hiro + girlfriend
- [ ] Emphasize long-distance relationship + language barrier angle
- [ ] Put ad money into highest-performing creative
- [ ] Track Pixel data for signup conversions

**Friend-of-Friends Method:**

- [ ] Improve distribution through personal network
- [ ] Ask engaged users for intros
- [ ] Justin will show Kaiwa to women in med school

**Weekly Updates:**

- [ ] Send Justin email update every week about progress
- [ ] Share wins, conversion data, creative performance

### 🎯 Success Metrics (Justin's Perspective)

**Product Validation:**

- Justin said: "Great MVP, totally ready for distribution"
- Core feature works
- Main blocker: 2% AI self-response glitch (needs immediate fix)

**Next Milestones:**

- Get 1% → 8-10% paid conversion
- Achieve through: Ghibli characters + immersive backgrounds + better persona
- Native app once product-market fit is clearer

### 🤝 Justin's Commitment

**Support Offered:**

- Will meet Hiro in Asia (mid-January to mid-February 2026)
- Will show Kaiwa to women in med school
- Available for ongoing product feedback
- Wants weekly email updates

### ⚠️ Strategic Decision Required: Reddit vs TikTok

**Conflict:**

- **Current strategy** (DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY.md): Reddit-first, skip TikTok
- **Justin's advice**: TikTok-first, skip Reddit

**Recommendation**:

- **A/B test both approaches** for 2 weeks
- Week 1-2: Reddit comments + TikTok UGC ads in parallel
- Measure: signups, engagement, conversion rate per channel
- Double down on winner

**Pros of Reddit Approach:**

- SEO benefits (ranks in Google)
- High intent (people searching for solutions)
- Text-based (easier to execute)

**Pros of TikTok Approach:**

- Visual/emotional connection (see Hiro's face, relationship story)
- Younger target market (women 25-35)
- Justin has proven this works (Cali app)
- Phone-based follow-up more effective

**Hypothesis**: TikTok may win because relationship learning is **emotional**, not just informational.

## 🎨 Implementation: Ghibli-Style Character Faces

**Status**: IN PROGRESS (November 12, 2025)

**Goal**: Make characters memorable to increase paid conversion (1% → 8-10%)

**✅ VALIDATED by Justin Kim**: "Make characters cute, Ghibli-style. This differentiates you from Pingo.AI which lacks personality."

### Technical Implementation Plan

**✅ DISCOVERY**: Complete character generation system already exists at `/dev/animated`!

**Phase 1: Generate Characters Using Existing System** (Week 1) ← **START HERE**
**What exists**:

- Full UI at http://localhost:5173/dev/animated
- OpenAI DALL-E 3 & GPT-Image-1 integration
- Studio Ghibli prompts for ALL 25+ speakers
- Batch generation with live preview
- Cost tracking and download capability

**Steps to generate**:

1. Open `/dev/animated` in browser
2. Select DALL-E 3 model (most consistent)
3. Click "Generate Hiro", "Generate Yuki", etc.
4. Review generated images for quality
5. Download images (WebP format)
6. Optimize to 256x256px, <20KB

**Characters to generate first**:

- **Yuki** (Tokyo woman) - warm, friendly
- **Hiro** (Tokyo man) - casual, relaxed
- **Minami** (Osaka woman) - energetic
- **+2-3 Korean characters** for K-drama scenarios (per Justin's advice)

**Cost**: $0.40 for 5 characters ($0.08 × 5)
**Timeline**: 30 minutes
**Priority**: HIGH (Justin confirmed this increases stickiness)

**Phase 2: Code Integration** (Week 1)

1. Store images in `/src/lib/assets/characters/`
2. Update `Speaker` schema: add `characterImageUrl` and `characterImageAlt` fields
3. Update `/src/lib/data/speakers.ts` with image paths
4. Modify `MessageBubble.svelte` (lines 200-218) to display character images
5. Test locally, then deploy

**Detailed implementation guide**: See `/GHIBLI_CHARACTER_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Phase 3: Testing & Validation (Week 2)**

- A/B test: Character faces vs. Kitsune mascot
- Track metrics:
  - Conversation completion rate
  - Return rate (next day)
  - Paid conversion rate
- User feedback: "Do you remember the character's name?"

**Phase 4: Professional Commission (If Validated)**

- Commission artist for production-quality characters
- Cost: $300-1000 for 10 characters
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks

### Key Design Decisions

**Character Personas Based on Scenarios:**

- **Yuki** - Warm, friendly woman (family dinner, casual conversations)
- **Hiro** - Relaxed man (date, friendly chats)
- **Minami** - Energetic Osaka personality (mixers, celebrations)
- **Nurse Character** - Professional, caring (medical scenarios)
- **Parent Character** - Mature, traditional (partner's parent scenarios)

**Style Guidelines:**

- Studio Ghibli aesthetic (soft watercolors, warm tones)
- Friendly, approachable expressions
- Headshots with simple backgrounds
- 40x40px display size (optimize as 256x256px source)
- WebP format, <20KB per image

### Success Metrics

**Target**: If character faces increase paid conversion by 2%+ → Commission professional art
**Timeline**: 2 weeks to validate concept
**Budget**: $10-30 (testing), $300-1000 (production)

### Files to Modify

- `/src/lib/server/db/schema/speakers.ts` - Add character image fields
- `/src/lib/data/speakers.ts` - Add image URLs to speaker data
- `/src/lib/features/conversation/components/MessageBubble.svelte` - Update avatar rendering
- `/src/lib/assets/characters/` - New directory for character images

---

## ✅ Conversation Ending & Analysis Flow (Already Implemented)

**User Request**: "I do want something where users can press to end the conversation and going to analysis instead of taking it out completely."

**Status**: ✅ **THIS ALREADY EXISTS**

**Current Flow**:

1. User in active conversation
2. Clicks **"End conversation" button** in FAB menu (ConversationFab.svelte:89-100)
3. Transitions to **ConversationReviewableState** (review screen)
4. Shows conversation summary, analytics, message history
5. User clicks **"Get Learning Analysis"** button
6. Full analysis runs and displays results

**Files involved**:

- `/src/lib/features/conversation/components/ConversationFab.svelte` - End button
- `/src/lib/features/conversation/components/ConversationReviewableState.svelte` - Review + analysis

**No changes needed** - flow works as requested!

---

## ✅ Transcript Toggle (Already Supported)

**User Request**: Don't remove transcript completely, just make it hideable.

**Status**: ✅ **ALREADY CONFIGURABLE**

Transcript display is controlled via UI settings and can be shown/hidden based on user preference. The Jony Ive recommendation to "hide transcript by default" can be implemented by changing the default setting, not removing the feature.

**Recommendation**: Keep transcript hideable (not removed) as user requested.

---

## 🔧 Technical Infrastructure Improvements

### ✅ Structured Logging Implementation (Completed: November 16, 2025)

**Problem**:

- 100+ console.log statements in production code exposing sensitive data
- No structured logging for production debugging
- Performance impact from excessive logging
- Difficult to debug production issues without proper log levels

**Solution Implemented**:

- Created server-side logger (`src/lib/server/logger.ts`)
  - JSON structured logging in production
  - Pretty console output in development
  - Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
  - Context support for additional metadata
- Created client-side logger (`src/lib/logger.ts`)
  - Suppresses debug/info logs in production
  - Only warns/errors shown to users in production
- Replaced console statements across:
  - All server services (stripe, email, payment, usage, etc.)
  - All repositories
  - All API routes (/api/analysis/_, /api/features/_, /api/cron/\*)
  - Server hooks
  - Database utilities
  - All stores (audio, conversation, user, settings, etc.)

**Benefits**:

- Reduced production noise (client only shows warnings/errors)
- Structured logs ready for log aggregation tools
- Better debugging with context metadata
- Consistent logging API across codebase
- Improved security (no sensitive data in client logs)

**Files Modified**: 64 files, 999 insertions, 723 deletions

**Commit**: `bb9520b` - Replace production console.log with structured logging
