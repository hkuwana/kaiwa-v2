# Product Advisory Board (PAB) Screening Framework

## Overview

This framework helps select 8-10 core PAB members from 10+ interested candidates (7-8 from USJC, 2-3 scattered contacts) while maintaining strategic diversity aligned with Kaiwa's ICP.

---

## Core Selection Principles

### 1. ICP Persona Distribution (Priority Weighting)

Target composition for 8-10 person PAB:

| Persona                        | Target # | Priority    | Why                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bilingual Spouse** (Sofia)   | 3-4      | **HIGHEST** | Phase 1 ICP, highest emotional urgency, easiest messaging fit |
| **Heritage Speaker** (David)   | 2-3      | **HIGH**    | Phase 2 ICP, cyclical engagement, deep emotional connection   |
| **Relocation Expat** (Jamie)   | 2        | **MEDIUM**  | Phase 3 ICP, long LTV, large TAM                              |
| **Permanent Immigrant** (Rosa) | 1        | **LOW**     | Phase 4 ICP, validates professional use case                  |

**Key Rule**: NO MORE than 4 people from the same persona category.

### 2. Diversity Dimensions (Beyond Persona)

**Language Diversity** (Critical):

- Minimum 3 different target languages represented
- Avoid all members learning Japanese (even if that's your relationship)
- Include: Spanish, Arabic, Mandarin, German, French, etc.

**Geographic Diversity**:

- Mix of US-based and international users
- Different cultural contexts (Asia, Europe, Latin America)
- Different time zones for global perspective

**Professional Diversity**:

- Mix of tech, healthcare, creative, business backgrounds
- Different income levels (pricing sensitivity testing)

**Organizational Diversity**:

- **Maximum 2-3 from USJC** in core PAB
- Rest from scattered contacts or new recruitment
- Prevents groupthink and USJC-centric feedback

### 3. Engagement Quality Indicators

**High-Quality Signals**:

- Has a specific "ticking clock" event (meeting family, relocation, reunion)
- Actively using language learning tools currently (shows commitment)
- Can articulate emotional pain point clearly
- Has availability for monthly 1-hour meetings
- Willing to test features and give candid feedback

**Red Flags**:

- Just curious, no real urgency
- "I might learn [language] someday"
- Only interested because friends are doing it
- Too busy to engage monthly

**Subject**: Kaiwa Product Advisory Board - Quick Survey (2 min)

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for your interest in joining Kaiwa's Product Advisory Board! We've had an overwhelming response, which is incredibly exciting.

To make sure we create the most valuable experience for everyone, I'm organizing two different engagement opportunities:

1. **Core Product Advisory Board** (8-10 people, monthly meetings, early access, high involvement)
2. **Pilot Program** (larger group, quarterly check-ins, early access, lighter involvement)

Could you fill out this quick 2-minute survey so I can match you with the best fit?

[Link to survey]

Both groups will get:

- Free access to Kaiwa
- Direct influence on product development
- Community with other language learners

The difference is primarily time commitment and depth of involvement. I want to make sure you're in the group that works best for your schedule and goals!

Thank you,
[Your name]

## Scoring & Selection Matrix

### Step 1: Categorize by Persona

After receiving responses, categorize each candidate:

| Candidate Name  | Persona Type     | Language | Urgency (1-5)                   | Engagement Quality (1-5)       | Organization     | Professional BG | Geography |
| --------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Example: Sarah  | Bilingual Spouse | Japanese | 5 (meeting parents in 2 months) | 5 (daily practice, clear pain) | USJC             | Designer        | SF        |
| Example: Miguel | Heritage Speaker | Spanish  | 4 (reunion in 4 months)         | 4 (weekly practice)            | Friend of friend | Engineer        | LA        |

### Step 2: Apply Selection Criteria

**Must-Have Criteria** (Eliminate if missing):

- [ ] Has real urgency/ticking clock OR ongoing relational need
- [ ] Can commit to monthly meetings (for Core PAB)
- [ ] Currently practicing or ready to start immediately
- [ ] Can articulate clear pain point

**Scoring System** (1-5 scale):

**ICP Alignment (Weight: 40%)**

- 5 = Perfect Sofia/David persona match
- 4 = Strong Jamie persona match
- 3 = Rosa persona or adjacent
- 2 = Weak alignment
- 1 = Not aligned with any ICP

**Engagement Quality (Weight: 30%)**

- 5 = Specific event, active practice, clear pain articulation
- 4 = General urgency, regular practice
- 3 = Moderate interest, some practice
- 2 = Low urgency
- 1 = Passive interest

**Diversity Value (Weight: 30%)**

- 5 = Unique language + unique org + unique geography + unique profession
- 4 = 3 out of 4 diversity dimensions
- 3 = 2 out of 4 diversity dimensions
- 2 = 1 out of 4 diversity dimensions
- 1 = No diversity value (duplicate profile)

**Calculate Total Score**:

```
Total = (ICP Alignment × 0.4) + (Engagement Quality × 0.3) + (Diversity Value × 0.3)
```

### Step 3: Apply Diversity Constraints

**Hard Rules**:

1. Maximum 3 from USJC in Core PAB
2. Maximum 4 from same persona category
3. Minimum 3 different languages
4. At least 1 non-US based member (if possible)

**Optimization**:

- If choosing between two similar candidates, prefer:
  - Higher urgency (closer deadline)
  - Different language
  - Different organization
  - Phase 1 persona (Sofia) over later phases

### Step 4: Final Selection

**Core PAB (8-10 people)**:

- Top scorers who meet diversity constraints
- Mix weighted toward Sofia (3-4) and David (2-3) personas

**USJC Pilot Program (Remaining USJC candidates)**:

- Everyone from USJC NOT selected for Core PAB
- Frame as organizational partnership

**Future Recruitment (If needed)**:

- If you need to fill gaps after USJC selection:
  - Recruit 1-2 Spanish heritage speakers
  - Recruit 1-2 expats learning Mandarin/Arabic
  - Recruit 1 professional immigrant (medical/tech)

---

## Example Selection Outcome

**Scenario**: 8 from USJC, 2 from scattered contacts = 10 total candidates

**Core PAB (8 people)**:

1. **Sarah** (USJC) - Bilingual Spouse, Japanese, meeting parents in 2 months
2. **Miguel** (Friend referral) - Heritage Speaker, Spanish, family reunion in 3 months
3. **Aisha** (USJC) - Permanent Immigrant, Arabic, advancing career
4. **David** (Friend of friend) - Bilingual Spouse, German, living with partner's family

6. **Marco** - Relocation Expat, French, moving to Paris for work
7. **Lisa** - Bilingual Spouse, Mandarin, marrying into Chinese family
8. **Carlos** - Heritage Speaker, Spanish, teaching kids about culture

**USJC Pilot Program (5 people)**:

- Remaining 5 USJC candidates who didn't make Core PAB
- Frame as "USJC Early Access Cohort"
- Quarterly check-ins, lighter involvement

**Why This Works**:

- 3 from USJC in Core PAB (not overwhelming)
- 4 Bilingual Spouse, 3 Heritage Speaker, 1 each Expat/Immigrant
- 6 different languages represented
- Mix of urgency levels
- Professional diversity
- USJC members feel valued (some in core, others in pilot)

## Decision Framework: Core PAB vs. Pilot Program

Use this to guide candidates:

| Question         | Core PAB                                         | Pilot Program                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Time commitment  | 1 hour/month + feature testing                   | 1 hour/quarter + light feedback          |
| Urgency level    | High (event in 1-6 months)                       | Medium (ongoing or >6 months)            |
| Engagement depth | High (detailed feedback, multiple sessions/week) | Medium (periodic check-ins)              |
| Influence        | Direct input on roadmap, feature prioritization  | Early access, general feedback           |
| Group size       | 8-10 people                                      | 15-20 people                             |
| Meeting format   | Monthly video calls                              | Quarterly async surveys + optional calls |

---

## Timeline

**Week 1**:

- Send screening survey to all 10+ candidates
- Deadline: 3-4 days to respond

**Week 2**:

- Score and categorize responses
- Apply selection criteria
- Make final Core PAB selections

**Week 3**:

- Send personalized invitations:
  - Core PAB members: "You're in!" message
  - Pilot Program members: "We'd love you in our USJC cohort!" message
- Schedule first Core PAB meeting

**Week 4**:

- First Core PAB meeting
- Kick off USJC Pilot Program with async welcome

---

## Success Metrics

Track these to validate your selection:

**Core PAB**:

- Attendance rate at monthly meetings (target: >80%)
- Average sessions per member per month (target: 8+)
- Quality of feedback (are they giving actionable insights?)
- Retention at 6 months (target: >70%)

**USJC Pilot**:

- Engagement rate (target: >50% complete quarterly surveys)
- Conversion to paid users (target: >30% after pilot)
- Referral quality (are they bringing friends?)

---

## Notes

- **Friendship dynamics**: If multiple USJC friends are in both groups, make sure to communicate clearly that both groups are equally valued—just different involvement levels
- **FOMO management**: Position Pilot as "exclusive USJC partnership," not "rejected from Core PAB"
- **Flexibility**: If someone in Pilot Program shows exceptional engagement, you can invite them to Core PAB later
- **Exit strategy**: Both groups should have clear 3-month "trial period" where people can opt out if it's not working
