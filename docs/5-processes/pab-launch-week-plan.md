# PAB Launch Week - Action Plan

**Context**: You have enough people ready to launch your Product Advisory Board. This guide covers your immediate next week.

---

## 🎯 Your 3 Initial Actions for PAB Members

When you send your welcome email, ask members to complete these 3 things:

### ✅ Action 1: Fill Out Availability Poll (Due: 48 hours)

**What to send**:

```
📅 First Task: When can you meet?

Please fill out this quick poll for our first Product Advisory Board meeting:
[Calendly/When2Meet link]

We're looking at [next 2 weeks' date range] for a 1-hour video call.

This will be our kickoff where we:
- Get to know each other's language learning journeys
- Demo the current product
- Gather your initial reactions
- Decide what to prioritize

⏰ Please respond by [date 48 hours from now] so I can lock in a time!
```

### ✅ Action 2: Complete Your First Scenario (Due: 5 days)

**What to send**:

```
🗣️ Second Task: Try Kaiwa (aim for the analysis part!)

Please try at least one conversation scenario on Kaiwa this week.

**Your mission**: Get to the analysis/feedback part after your conversation.

**What to note**:
- What felt natural vs confusing?
- Did anything surprise you (good or bad)?
- What's missing that you wish was there?

You can share feedback in our PAB group or bring it to our first meeting.

**Beta Access Link**: [link]
**Login credentials**: [credentials]
```

### ✅ Action 3: Share Your Story (Due: Before first meeting)

**What to send**:

```
💭 Third Task: Tell us your story

In our PAB group [Slack/Discord/WhatsApp link], please introduce yourself:

1. What language are you learning?
2. What's the ONE conversation you're preparing for?
3. Why does this conversation matter to you?

This helps everyone get to know each other and helps me understand what scenarios to prioritize building.

No essay needed - 2-3 sentences is perfect!
```

## 📱 Reddit Value Comment Templates (Justin's Recommendation)

### Template 1: Meeting Partner's Family

**When you see**: "I'm nervous about meeting my boyfriend's parents who only speak [language]"

**Comment**:

```
I totally understand this anxiety! A few things that have helped people I've talked to:

1. **Pick 3 "safety" phrases**: Have 3-5 go-to phrases you're super comfortable with (greetings, thank you, compliments on food). You'll use these 80% of the time.

2. **Prep specific scenarios**: Practice the dinner table conversation specifically, not just random vocab. The context makes it way less scary.

3. **Have a "lifeline" signal**: Agree with your partner beforehand on a subtle signal for when you need help or a translation.

The fact that you're trying means everything to them. Even broken [language] shows respect and effort.

You've got this!
```

**Follow-up if they respond**: Mention Kaiwa naturally: "Actually, this is exactly why I built [tool] - to practice those specific scenarios. Happy to share if you're interested!"

### Template 2: Heritage Speakers

**When you see**: "I can understand my parents speaking [language] but I can't speak it back. I feel so ashamed."

**Comment**:

```
This is SO common and nothing to be ashamed of! You're a receptive bilingual - it's a real thing.

The good news: Your comprehension gives you a huge head start. You just need to activate your productive skills.

A few tips:
1. **Start with texting**: Write simple messages to family in [language]. It's lower pressure than speaking.

2. **Narrate your day**: Talk to yourself in [language] while doing everyday tasks. Sounds weird, but it builds fluency.

3. **Record yourself**: Practice a specific thing you want to say (like asking about family history), record it, listen back, try again.

Your family will be thrilled you're making the effort. Start small - even one sentence is progress.
```

### Template 3: Expats/Relocation

**When you see**: "Moving to [country] in 3 months, terrified about making friends in [language]"

**Comment**:

```
3 months is actually decent prep time! Focus on conversational scenarios, not grammar drills.

**What to practice:**
- Small talk (weather, weekend plans, work)
- Asking people about themselves (shows interest, takes pressure off you)
- Cultural norms (how to greet, thank, decline politely)

**Mindset shift:**
Most locals appreciate ANY effort to speak their language. You don't need to be fluent - you need to be friendly and willing to try.

**Practical tip:**
Find 2-3 scenarios you'll 100% encounter (ordering at cafe, chatting with coworker, asking for directions) and practice those until you're confident.

You'll make friends by being genuine, not by being perfect at [language].
```
