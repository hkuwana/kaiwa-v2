## Program Overview

### What It's Called:
**"Kaiwa Founding Members"** (not "Product Advisory Board")

### Why the Name Change:
- "Advisory Board" + paying = feels like "pay to work"
- "Founding Members" + paying = feels like "early adopter discount"
- Better positioning: exclusive club, not unpaid labor

### Program Structure:
- **Total spots:** 12 people
- **Currently filled:** 10 spots
- **Remaining:** 2 spots
- **Deadline:** Tomorrow evening

---

## Pricing & Value Proposition

### Founding Member Pricing:
**$10/month (locked in forever)**

**Why $10/month:**
- Covers your API costs (OpenAI Realtime API: ~$10/user/month for typical use)
- You're not making profit on these 12 people
- It's an investment in getting the right early users
- Long-term "loss" worth it for feedback, testimonials, and loyalty

**Regular pricing when you launch publicly:**
- $19/month standard

**Value proposition:**
- 50% discount locked in forever
- Even if you raise prices to $29/month later, they stay at $10
- Founding members are rewarded for early support

### What's Included:
✅ $10/month rate (locked in forever)
✅ Unlimited access to Kaiwa
✅ Monthly 1-hour video calls with you + other founding members
✅ Direct input on features and roadmap
✅ Exclusive WhatsApp/Slack/Discord community
✅ Early access to all new features
✅ "I was here from day 1" status

### Fair Use:
- Typical use: 15-25 conversations/month
- If someone consistently uses 40+ conversations/month, you may ask them to discuss a custom plan
- Be transparent but fair

## The 3 Initial Actions for Members

When someone joins, they complete 3 tasks in their first week:

### ✅ Action 1: Fill Out Availability Poll (Due: 48 hours)
**Purpose:** Lock in first meeting date
**Tool:** Calendly or When2Meet
**Message:**
```
📅 First Task: When can you meet?

Please fill out this quick poll for our first Founding Members meeting:
[Calendly/When2Meet link]

We're looking at [next 2 weeks' date range] for a 1-hour video call.

This will be our kickoff where we:
- Get to know each other's language learning journeys
- Demo the current product
- Gather your initial reactions
- Decide what to prioritize

⏰ Please respond by [date 48 hours from now] so I can lock in a time!
```

### ✅ Action 2: Complete Your First Conversation (Due: 5 days)
**Purpose:** Get hands-on with product immediately
**Message:**
```
🗣️ Second Task: Try Kaiwa!

Please try at least one conversation scenario on Kaiwa this week.

**Your mission:** Complete a full conversation and review the analysis/feedback.

**What to note:**
- What felt natural vs confusing?
- Did anything surprise you (good or bad)?
- What's missing that you wish was there?

You can share feedback in our group or bring it to our first meeting.

**Access Link:** [link]
**Login credentials:** [credentials]
```

### ✅ Action 3: Share Your Story (Due: Before first meeting)
**Purpose:** Build community and gather persona data
**Message:**
```
💭 Third Task: Tell us your story

In our Founding Members group [WhatsApp/Slack/Discord link], please introduce yourself:

1. What language are you learning?
2. What's the ONE conversation you're preparing for?
3. Why does this conversation matter to you?

This helps everyone get to know each other and helps me understand what scenarios to prioritize building.

No essay needed - 2-3 sentences is perfect!
```

## Target Contacts & Messaging

### Priority 1: Maxi (WhatsApp) - SEND TONIGHT

**Context:** Met at Jason Calacanis event, wife is learning language to meet partner's family (perfect ICP)

**Message:**
```
Hey Maxi!

I'm locking in 12 Founding Members for Kaiwa this week

Your wife came to mind immediately

Founding Members pay $10/month (covers my API costs) vs $19/month regular price

They get locked in at $10 forever + monthly calls with me + help shape what we build

2 spots left, closing tomorrow evening

Based on what you mentioned about her, she'd be perfect

Want me to add her? Just need a yes 👍
```

Hi [Name],

Hiro (Brown '17) here. I'm locking in 12 Founding Members for Kaiwa this week.

Your honest feedback + monthly 1-hour calls

2 spots left. Closing tomorrow.

**Interested?** Reply "I'm in" and I'll send payment details.

Go Bruno,
Hiro

P.S. What languages are you working with as an Ambassador?
```

### Priority 3: Professor Shinohara (Email) - SEND TOMORROW

**Context:** Met for drinks, Waseda University professor researching L2 phonetic training

**Strategy:** Research collaboration (free for study participants) + Founding Members for other students

**Message:**
```
Subject: Great meeting you last week - quick collaboration idea

Hi Professor Shinohara,

Great having drinks last week! I've been thinking about your research on L2 phonetic training.

I'm building Kaiwa (trykaiwa.com) for high-stakes L2 conversation practice, and thought there might be a research collaboration opportunity.

**Research idea:**
Your expertise in L2 phonetics + usage data from Kaiwa could make for interesting research on scenario-based practice effects on production and anxiety reduction.

**Potential pilot:**
- 20-30 Waseda students (free access for study duration)
- Pre/post assessments (phonetic + anxiety measures)
- Co-authored publication

This could benefit your research, your students, and help validate Kaiwa academically.

**Would you be interested in a 15-min call to discuss?**

Also: If you know students who might benefit outside of a formal study, I'm offering 2 Founding Member spots ($10/month vs $19 regular price).

No pressure either way - just thought the alignment was worth exploring!

Best,
Hiro

P.S. Also happy to just grab coffee next time I'm in Tokyo and hear your thoughts on L2 practice tools!
```

### Priority 4: Your "Few Other People"

**Who are they?** List them here:
- [Add names and context]

**Template to customize:**
```
Hey [Name]!

Quick reach-out: I'm closing invites for Kaiwa Founding Members today (literally have 2 spots left).

I thought of you because [specific reason: "you mentioned learning Japanese" / "you're preparing for X" / etc].

Founding Members get:
✅ $10/month rate forever (vs $19 regular)
✅ Monthly calls with me + 10 others
✅ Help shape what we build
✅ Community of people in similar situations

Need to finalize by tomorrow evening.

Interested? Just reply "I'm in"!

No worries if not - would still love to catch up about [their situation] sometime!

[Your name]
```

## Marketing Strategy (Dual Approach)

### Approach A: Founding Members (High-Touch)
**Target:** 12 people total
**Goal:** Shape the product, deep feedback
**Time:** 1 hour/month meetings
**Compensation:** $10/month (vs $19 regular)
**Status:** 10/12 filled, need 2 more

### Approach B: Student Ambassador Program (Scalable)
**Target:** 2-3 students initially (scalable to 50+)
**Goal:** Campus distribution, word of mouth
**Time:** 2-3 hours/month activities
**Compensation:** $50/month stipend + free access

**How they work together:**
```
Student Ambassadors (awareness)
    ↓
Drive signups and trials
    ↓
Best users → invited to Founding Members
    ↓
Founding Members → deep product feedback
    ↓
Product improves
    ↓
Ambassadors have better product to promote
    ↓
Cycle repeats
```

### Student Ambassador Program (Future Phase)

**When to launch:** After filling Founding Members spots (Week 2)

**Value prop for students:**
- $50/month stipend
- Free lifetime access to Kaiwa
- "Ambassador" credential (resume builder)
- Direct line to founder
- Exclusive community with other ambassadors

**What they do:**
- Share Kaiwa with 5-10 students per semester
- Post on social media 2-3x/month
- Host 1 info session or demo per semester
- Collect feedback from users
- Report monthly

**Student Ambassador Pitch (for Brown Language Ambassadors who decline Founding Members):**
```
Subject: Different opportunity - Student Ambassador ($50/month)

Hi [Name],

Even if Founding Members isn't your thing, I have another idea:

**Kaiwa Student Ambassador Program**

What you get:
✅ $50/month stipend
✅ Free lifetime access
✅ "Founding Ambassador" credential
✅ Direct access to me (fellow Brown alum)

What you do:
📱 Post 2-3x/month on social (we give you templates)
🎤 Host 1 info session per semester (we give you materials)
💬 Share with students you work with

Time: 2-3 hours/month

This is literally what you already do as a Language Ambassador, but you'd get paid!

Only taking 2-3 Founding Ambassadors at Brown.

Interested? Reply "tell me more"!

Go Bruno,
Hiro
```

### Why NOT to Do Broad Student Marketing (Yet)

**Cost Reality:**
- Heavy student user: $10-15/month in API costs
- Students willing to pay: $0-10/month
- 50 free students = $500-750/month burn

**Better strategy:**
- Focus on paying customers (professionals with urgency)
- Do ONE strategic student partnership (Shinohara research = controlled cost)
- Launch Student Ambassador program (2-3 paid ambassadors, not 100 free users)
- Add student discount tier later ($9/month) but don't aggressively market to students yet

**When to revisit:**
- After you have 50+ paying customers
- After you've validated product-market fit
- After you have more budget for student acquisition

---

## Payment & Operations Setup

### Payment Collection (Choose One):

**Option 1: Stripe Subscription (RECOMMENDED)**
```
Steps:
1. Log into Stripe dashboard
2. Create Product: "Kaiwa Founding Members"
3. Set price: $10/month recurring
4. Generate payment link
5. Send link to members after they say "I'm in"

Pros: Professional, automatic billing, easy to manage
Time: 10 minutes to set up
```

**Option 2: Manual (Venmo/PayPal)**
```
Steps:
1. Request $10/month from each member manually
2. Track in spreadsheet
3. Follow up on late payments

Pros: Simple, no Stripe fees
Cons: Not scalable, unprofessional, manual work
```

**Recommendation:** Use Stripe. It's worth the 2.9% fee for automatic billing.

---

### Community Platform (Choose One):

**Option 1: WhatsApp Group**
- Pros: Everyone has it, low friction, instant
- Cons: Less organized, hard to search, casual

**Option 2: Slack Workspace**
- Pros: Professional, organized, searchable
- Cons: Another app to check, some learning curve

**Option 3: Discord Server**
- Pros: Good for communities, voice channels, organized
- Cons: Less professional, younger demographic

**Recommendation:** WhatsApp for simplicity, or Slack if you want more professional feel.

## Key Principles to Remember

### 1. Founding Members = Investment, Not Revenue
These 12 people at $10/month are:
- ✅ Worth it for feedback and testimonials
- ✅ Worth it for loyalty and referrals
- ✅ Worth it even if you "lose money" long-term
- ✅ Building the product WITH the right people

### 2. Keep It Simple
- Don't overcomplicate the offer
- Don't add tiers or options
- Just: $10/month, 12 spots, locked in forever

### 3. Be Transparent
- "This covers my API costs"
- "I'm not making profit on you 12"
- "Later users pay $19-29/month"
- Honesty builds trust

### 4. Execute Fast
- You have momentum NOW
- 13-14 people already interested
- Send messages tonight
- Close roster tomorrow
- Launch Week 2

### 5. Students = Later
- Don't chase free student users yet
- Do ONE strategic partnership (Shinohara research)
- Focus on paying customers first
- Add student tier when you have budget
