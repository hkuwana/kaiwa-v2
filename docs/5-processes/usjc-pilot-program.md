# USJC Pilot Program Structure

## Overview

The USJC (United States Japan Council) Pilot Program is a strategic organizational partnership that engages the USJC cohort (5-7 members not selected for Core PAB) in a lighter, community-focused early access program.

---

## Strategic Rationale

### Why Create a Separate USJC Track?

**The Challenge**:

- 7-8 out of 10+ interested candidates came from USJC
- Having all USJC members in Core PAB would:
  - Limit diversity of perspectives
  - Create organizational groupthink
  - Reduce geographic/language/persona diversity

**The Solution**:

- Select 2-3 USJC members for Core PAB (based on ICP fit + diversity)
- Create USJC Pilot Program for remaining 4-6 USJC candidates
- Frame as "organizational partnership" rather than "rejection"

**The Benefits**:

1. **No one gets rejected**: Everyone who expressed interest gets value
2. **Maintains PAB quality**: Core PAB stays diverse and focused
3. **Leverages organizational relationship**: USJC becomes strategic partner
4. **Creates cohort learning data**: See how groups from same org use Kaiwa
5. **Future partnership potential**: Could lead to organizational licensing
6. **Friendship dynamics managed**: Some USJC friends in Core, some in Pilot

---

## Program Structure

### Duration

**Initial Pilot**: 3 months with option to extend

**Timeline**:

- Month 1: Onboarding + exploration phase
- Month 2: Active use + feedback collection
- Month 3: First formal check-in + evaluation
- Months 4-6: Continuation based on engagement (optional extension)

### Participation Model

**What USJC Cohort Members Get**:

1. Free unlimited access to Kaiwa for 3 months (normally $19-29/mo)
2. Early access to new features before public launch
3. "USJC Founding Member" status + recognition
4. Private USJC cohort community (Slack/Discord/WhatsApp group)
5. Quarterly check-ins with founder (async surveys + optional calls)
6. Special discount if converting to paid after pilot (e.g., 50% off for 6 months)
7. Opportunity to practice together as a cohort

**What We're Looking For from Members**:

1. Use Kaiwa authentically for their own language learning
2. Complete quarterly feedback surveys (10-15 min, ~4 surveys total)
3. Optional: Attend quarterly group video calls (1 hour)
4. Optional: Share success stories or testimonials
5. Optional: Refer friends who fit Kaiwa's ICP

**Time Commitment**:

- **Minimum**: 10-15 min per quarter (surveys only)
- **Ideal**: 1 hour per quarter (survey + optional call) + regular Kaiwa use
- **No penalty**: Low engagement won't affect access during pilot

---

## Pilot Program Goals

### Primary Goals

1. **User Validation**:
   - Do USJC members use Kaiwa regularly?
   - Which scenarios are most popular?
   - What pain points do they experience?

2. **Cohort Learning Insights**:
   - Do members from same organization practice together?
   - Does shared community increase accountability/engagement?
   - What group features would be valuable?

3. **Conversion Testing**:
   - After 3 months of free access, what % convert to paid?
   - What pricing model works best for this segment?
   - What retention rate can we expect?

4. **Referral Quality**:
   - Do USJC members refer other high-quality users?
   - What's the viral coefficient?

### Secondary Goals

1. **Organizational Partnership Potential**:
   - Is there interest in USJC-wide licensing?
   - Could we partner with other USJC chapters?
   - What would group/organizational pricing look like?

2. **Community Features**:
   - Would members value group practice sessions?
   - Interest in cohort challenges or competitions?
   - Peer-to-peer feedback or practice matching?

3. **Content Creation**:
   - Can we collect testimonials or success stories?
   - Would members participate in case studies or interviews?
   - Social proof for marketing (with permission)?

- Send email: "Your pilot is ending soon—here's what's next"
- Preview pricing options
- Highlight usage stats: "You practiced [X] times and completed [Y] scenarios!"
- Social proof: "Here's what other cohort members are saying..."

**Week 11**:

- Offer special USJC member discount:
  - 50% off for 6 months ($9.50/mo instead of $19)
  - OR Annual plan at discounted rate ($10/mo = $120/year)
  - Frame as "Founding Member Pricing—thank you for being part of the pilot"
- Include testimonials from cohort members (with permission)

**Week 12** (Pilot ends):

- Send final reminder with discount code
- Make transition seamless (no service interruption if they convert)
- Offer "pause" option: "Not ready to commit? Keep your account and come back when you need it"

**Week 13** (Post-pilot):

- Thank you email to those who converted
- Exit survey for those who didn't: "What would it take for you to come back?"
- Keep cohort group active for community (even non-paying members)

### Pricing Options for USJC Members

**Option 1: Monthly Subscription**

- Regular: $19/mo
- USJC Founding Member: $14/mo (26% off, indefinite)
- Positioning: "Thanks for being an early supporter"

**Option 2: Annual Subscription**

- Regular: $199/year ($16.58/mo)

   - Joint webinars or workshops

**When to Explore**:

- After 6 months: If >50% of USJC cohort converts and retains
- After collecting strong testimonials and success stories
- If referrals from USJC members are high-quality

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low Engagement**

- **Signal**: <30% active users after month 1
- **Mitigation**:
  - Increase weekly prompts and motivation
  - Offer 1:1 onboarding calls
  - Identify and remove barriers (technical issues, unclear value)
  - Consider shortening pilot to 2 months if engagement doesn't improve

**Risk 2: Cohort Drama**

- **Signal**: Negative interactions in group, members leaving group
- **Mitigation**:
  - Set clear community guidelines upfront
  - Moderate group actively
  - Address conflicts quickly and privately
  - Separate community from product (they can leave group but keep using Kaiwa)

**Risk 3: Low Conversion**

- **Signal**: <20% conversion to paid after pilot
- **Mitigation**:
  - Run exit surveys to understand why
  - Test different pricing levels
  - Offer extended trial or payment plans
  - Focus on those who do convert—understand their profile

**Risk 4: Feature Requests Overwhelm**

- **Signal**: Dozens of requests for features specific to one language or narrow use case
- **Mitigation**:
  - Acknowledge all feedback
  - Explain prioritization framework (ICP alignment)
  - Don't build for outliers during pilot
  - Save niche requests for post-launch

**Risk 5: FOMO or Resentment (Core PAB vs. Pilot)**

- **Signal**: USJC members asking "Why wasn't I picked for Core PAB?"
- **Mitigation**:
  - Messaging: "Both tracks are valuable, just different involvement levels"
  - Transparency: "Core PAB needed diversity across languages/orgs"
  - Flexibility: "You can join Core PAB later if a spot opens"
  - Emphasize USJC cohort benefits: "You have your own community"

---

## Communication Cadence

### Weekly (Low-Effort)

- Monday: Weekly motivation or tip
- Wednesday: Feature highlight or scenario spotlight
- Friday: Community win or member highlight

### Monthly (Medium-Effort)

- Product update email
- New feature announcements
- Usage stats summary (aggregate, not individual shaming)

### Quarterly (High-Effort)

- Comprehensive feedback survey
- Optional group video call
- Deep-dive on roadmap

### Ad-Hoc (As Needed)

- Respond to questions in group chat
- Troubleshoot technical issues
- Collect testimonials
- Share exciting milestones

   - Offer individual accounts, dissolve cohort structure

**Success Criteria for "Win"**:

- > 50% active users in month 3
- > 40% NPS score
- > 30% conversion to paid
- 3+ strong testimonials
- 5+ referrals generated

**If Successful, Next Steps**:
