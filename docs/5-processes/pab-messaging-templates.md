## 1. Initial Survey Email (To All Candidates)

**Subject**: Kaiwa Product Advisory Board - Quick Survey (2 min)

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

First off—**thank you** for your interest in joining Kaiwa's Product Advisory Board. I'm genuinely blown away by the response, and it means a lot that you're willing to support what we're building.

Here's the situation: I've had over 10 people express interest (which is incredible!), and I want to make sure everyone gets the experience that's right for them.

So I'm creating **two different ways to be involved**:

### Option 1: Core Product Advisory Board (8-10 people)
- Monthly 1-hour video meetings
- Hands-on feature testing and detailed feedback
- Direct influence on product roadmap
- High involvement, high impact

### Option 2: Early Access Pilot Program (larger group)
- Quarterly check-ins (mostly async)
- Early access to new features
- Lighter time commitment
- Community with other language learners

Both groups get free access to Kaiwa and direct input on development—the main difference is **time commitment and depth of involvement**.

**Could you fill out this 2-minute survey** so I can match you with the best fit?

I want to respect everyone's time and energy, and make sure you're in the group that aligns with what you're looking for.

Thanks for understanding, and for being part of this from the beginning!

[Your name]

P.S. If you have any questions about either option, just reply to this email—I'm happy to chat!

## 2. Core PAB Invitation (Selected Members)

**Subject**: You're in! Welcome to Kaiwa's Product Advisory Board

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

I'm excited to officially invite you to join **Kaiwa's Core Product Advisory Board**!

Based on your survey responses, you're an ideal fit for this group:
- [Personalize based on their response: "You're about to meet your partner's family in Japanese, which is exactly the high-stakes scenario Kaiwa is built for" OR "Your journey reconnecting with your family in Spanish is what Kaiwa is all about"]
- You have the availability and interest to give in-depth feedback
- Your perspective will add important diversity to the group

### What to Expect

**Time Commitment**:
- 1-hour monthly video meetings (we'll find a time that works for everyone)
- 2-3 hours/month of hands-on testing (as you use Kaiwa for your own learning)
- Async feedback via quick surveys (5-10 min)

**What You Get**:
- Free unlimited access to Kaiwa (launching [date])
- Early access to new features before anyone else
- Direct influence on what we build
- A community of fellow language learners facing similar challenges
- My eternal gratitude + acknowledgment as a founding member

**First Steps**:

1. **When works for you?** I'm scheduling our first PAB meeting for [week of X]. Please fill out this Calendly poll: [link]

2. **Join the group**: I'll add you to our private Slack/Discord/WhatsApp group [decide which platform] where we'll coordinate between meetings

3. **Get early access**: I'll send you login credentials for Kaiwa's beta version by [date]

### Our First Meeting

We'll use our first meeting to:
- Introduce ourselves and share our language learning journeys
- Talk through what you're hoping to get out of Kaiwa
- Walk through the current product and get your initial reactions
- Discuss what we should prioritize building

I'm genuinely excited to have you in this group. Your [specific detail about their situation] is exactly the kind of high-stakes language learning Kaiwa is designed for.

Thanks for being part of this from day one!

## 3. Pilot Program Invitation (USJC Cohort)

**Subject**: Join Kaiwa's USJC Early Access Pilot Program!

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for your interest in Kaiwa's Product Advisory Board!

Based on your survey and the overwhelming response from the USJC community (seriously, you all are amazing), I've organized a special **USJC Early Access Pilot Program** that I think you'll be perfect for.

### What This Means

Rather than a traditional Product Advisory Board (which requires monthly meetings and high time commitment), I'm creating a **USJC organizational partnership** that gives you:

**What You Get**:
- Free access to Kaiwa during the pilot period (3 months)
- Early access to new features before the public
- Quarterly check-ins where we gather feedback (mostly async, super lightweight)
- Private USJC cohort community to practice together
- Special "USJC Founding Member" status
- [Optional: discounted pricing if you continue after pilot]

**What We're Looking For**:
- Use Kaiwa as part of your language learning journey
- Share honest feedback via quick quarterly surveys (10-15 min)
- Optional: Join quarterly group calls if you're interested
- Spread the word if you love it!

**Time Commitment**: Much lighter than Core PAB—think 1 hour per quarter + however much you want to use Kaiwa for your own learning.

### Why This Structure?

I had 7-8 incredible people from USJC express interest, and I didn't want to say no to anyone. But I also wanted to make sure the Core PAB stayed small and diverse (across languages, geographies, personas).

So instead, I'm treating the USJC cohort as a **strategic institutional partnership**—you'll be testing Kaiwa as a group, which will give us valuable insights into how communities learn together.

Plus, some of your USJC friends are in the Core PAB (higher involvement), so you'll be collaborating across both groups.

### Next Steps

If this sounds good to you:

1. **Confirm your interest**: Just reply "I'm in!" and I'll add you to the USJC cohort group

2. **Join the community**: I'll add you to our private USJC cohort [Slack/Discord/WhatsApp] where you can connect with others

3. **Get access**: I'll send you login credentials by [date]

4. **First check-in**: I'll send a quick survey in [timeframe] to hear how your first few weeks go

### Honestly...

I'm really excited about this USJC partnership. You all are coming from a shared community, which means:
- You might practice together and keep each other accountable
- You can give feedback on how Kaiwa works for group/cohort learning
- We can explore organizational partnerships down the line (USJC chapters, etc.)

This is genuinely valuable—and I'm grateful you're willing to be part of it.

Let me know if you're in, or if you have any questions!

[Your name]

P.S. If your situation changes and you want to be more involved later, there's always flexibility. This is just the starting point!

## 4. Survey Non-Responder Follow-Up (After 3-4 Days)

**Subject**: Quick reminder: Kaiwa PAB Survey (2 min)

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Just a quick nudge—I'm closing the survey for Kaiwa's Product Advisory Board in the next 24 hours, and I wanted to make sure you didn't miss it!

No pressure at all if you're not interested or too busy right now. But if you are interested, this is your chance to weigh in on which group (Core PAB vs. Pilot Program) is the best fit for you.

Thanks!

## 5. "Thank You, But Not Right Now" Email (For Low-Fit Candidates)

**Subject**: Thank you for your interest in Kaiwa

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for filling out the Kaiwa Product Advisory Board survey and for your interest in supporting what we're building!

Based on your responses, I think Kaiwa might be a better fit for you **once we officially launch** rather than during the advisory/pilot phase. Here's why:

[Personalize based on their situation]:
- "Since you're still exploring which language to learn, you might benefit more from trying Kaiwa when we have more scenarios and languages available"
- "Since you're focused on test prep (JLPT/TOEFL), Kaiwa is more focused on conversational/relational fluency, so traditional test prep tools might serve you better right now"
- "Since you don't have availability for regular meetings, it might be better to join after launch when there's no commitment required"

I don't want to waste your time or energy on something that's not the right fit for where you are right now.

**But I'd love to stay in touch!**

I'll keep you on our early launch list, and I'll reach out when:
- We officially launch (expected: [date])
- We add scenarios/features that match your needs (like [specific area])
- We have special founding member pricing available

In the meantime, if anything changes or you want to chat about your language learning goals, just reply—I'm always happy to help!

Thanks again for your interest and support.

[Your name]

P.S. If you know anyone who's learning a language to connect with family or prepare for a big life event (meeting in-laws, moving abroad, family reunion), send them my way—that's exactly who Kaiwa is built for!

**Subject**: Thank you for your time with Kaiwa PAB

**Body**:

Hi [Name],

Thanks for letting me know that [Core PAB / Pilot Program] isn't the right fit for you right now. I totally understand—life gets busy, and priorities shift!

I really appreciate the time and feedback you've given so far. [Specific callout to something they contributed, if applicable: "Your suggestion about [X] was really helpful and we're actually building that now!"]

**A few things**:

1. **Keep your access**: You're welcome to keep using Kaiwa for your own language learning, even if you're stepping back from the advisory role

2. **Stay in touch**: I'll keep you on the early launch list, and feel free to reach out anytime if you want to chat or have ideas

3. **Come back anytime**: If your situation changes and you want to rejoin later, the door is always open

Thanks again for being part of this from the beginning. I wish you the best with [their language learning goal / other priority]!

## Communication Best Practices

### Tone Guidelines
- **Warm but not desperate**: You're grateful, but this is a partnership
- **Clear about value exchange**: They help you, you give them free access + influence
- **Respectful of time**: Always estimate time commitments accurately
- **Honest about fit**: Better to redirect someone than have them churn

### Timing
- **Survey deadline**: Give 3-4 days, send one reminder
- **Meeting reminders**: 1 week before + 24 hours before
- **Check-ins**: Quarterly for pilot, monthly for core PAB
- **Response time**: Try to reply to questions within 24 hours

### Personalization Tips
- Reference their specific language and goal in every email
- Call out specific contributions they've made
- Use their name (obviously)
- Match their communication style (formal vs. casual)

### USJC Friendship Dynamics
- **Acknowledge the relationship**: "I know many of you are friends, which is great!"
- **Normalize different tracks**: "Some of you are in Core PAB, some in Pilot—both are valuable"
- **Avoid favoritism language**: Don't say "Core PAB is better"
- **Emphasize partnership**: "USJC cohort is a special organizational partnership"

## FAQ Responses (Copy-Paste Ready)

**Q: "Why wasn't I selected for Core PAB?"**

A: "Great question! Core PAB is limited to 8-10 people to keep discussions focused and actionable. I prioritized diversity across languages, personas, and organizations to make sure we get the widest range of perspectives. But I genuinely value your input, which is why I want you in the Pilot Program—it's a different level of involvement, but equally important for shaping Kaiwa."

**Q: "Can I switch from Pilot to Core PAB later?"**

A: "Absolutely! If you're super engaged in the Pilot Program and want to join Core PAB when a spot opens up, I'd love to have you. Think of the first 3 months as a trial period to see what level of involvement works for you."

**Q: "Do I get paid for this?"**

A: "Great question. Right now, compensation is free unlimited access to Kaiwa (normally $19-29/mo) + early access to features + direct influence on the product. If the time commitment becomes more significant down the line, I'm open to discussing additional compensation or perks."

**Q: "What if I don't use Kaiwa much in a given month?"**

A: "No worries at all! Life happens. For Core PAB, I just ask that you try to make the monthly meetings when you can and give feedback when you do use the product. For Pilot Program, it's even more flexible—engage when it makes sense for you."

**Q: "What languages does Kaiwa support?"**

A: "We're launching with [list languages]. If your target language isn't on that list yet, we'll add it based on demand—and your feedback will help us prioritize which languages to build next!"

**Q: "When does Kaiwa officially launch?"**

A: "We're planning to launch publicly in [timeframe]. As a PAB/Pilot member, you'll get early access at least [X weeks] before the public launch."
