# PAB Quick-Start Guide

## Your Situation

**What You Have**:
- 10+ people interested in Product Advisory Board
- 7-8 from USJC (United States Japan Council)
- 2-3 scattered contacts (friends of friends)
- All seem excited and engaged

**The Challenge**:
- Don't want to reject anyone (you asked, they responded!)
- Too many from one organization = limited diversity
- Need to maintain quality feedback and diverse perspectives
- USJC folks are friends, which complicates dynamics

---

## The Solution: Two-Track Approach

### Track 1: Core Product Advisory Board (8-10 people)
**Who**: 2-3 from USJC + 2-3 scattered contacts + 2-4 new recruits (if needed)

**Purpose**:
- High-touch feedback on product development
- Monthly meetings, detailed testing
- Direct influence on roadmap

**Why This Size/Composition**:
- Small enough for productive discussions
- Diverse across: personas, languages, geographies, organizations
- Weighted toward Phase 1 ICP (Bilingual Spouse persona)

### Track 2: USJC Pilot Program (4-6 people)
**Who**: Remaining USJC members not in Core PAB

**Purpose**:
- Organizational partnership pilot
- Test cohort learning model
- Lighter involvement, still valuable

**Why This Works**:
- No one gets rejected (everyone has a path)
- USJC relationship becomes strategic (not just individual users)
- Tests potential for organizational licensing
- Maintains friendship dynamics (some in Core, some in Pilot)

## Quick Decision Matrix: Who Goes Where?

Use this simple flowchart for each candidate:

```
START: Review their survey response

Q1: Do they have a specific "ticking clock" event within 6 months?
├─ NO → Likely PILOT or DECLINE
└─ YES → Continue to Q2

Q2: Are they from USJC?
├─ NO → STRONG candidate for CORE PAB
└─ YES → Continue to Q3

Q3: Do they represent a unique persona/language/background we don't have yet?
├─ NO → Likely PILOT (we have enough USJC representation)
└─ YES → Continue to Q4

Q4: Do they match Sofia (Bilingual Spouse) or David (Heritage Speaker) persona?
├─ NO → Likely PILOT (Phase 3-4 persona, lower priority)
└─ YES → STRONG candidate for CORE PAB

Q5: How many USJC members are already in CORE PAB?
├─ 3+ → This person goes to PILOT
└─ <3 → This person goes to CORE PAB
```

## Critical ICP Alignment: What to Look For

### High-Priority (Core PAB Candidates)

**Persona: Bilingual Spouse (Sofia)**
- Learning language to connect with partner's family
- Specific event coming up (meeting parents, wedding, moving abroad)
- Emotional stakes: "What if they don't like me?"
- Languages: Japanese, Spanish, Mandarin, Arabic, German, Korean, etc.

**Persona: Heritage Speaker (David)**
- Grew up hearing language but can't produce it
- Reconnecting with family/roots
- Emotional stakes: Shame, disconnection
- Languages: Spanish, Mandarin, Korean, Arabic, etc.

### Medium-Priority (Core PAB or Pilot)

**Persona: Relocation Expat (Jamie)**
- Moving to new country for work/life
- Building social life, not just surviving
- Timeframe: Moving in next 3-6 months
- Languages: German, French, Spanish, Mandarin, etc.

### Lower-Priority (Pilot or Recruit Later)

**Persona: Permanent Immigrant (Rosa)**
- Already living in new country
- Professional advancement focus
- Longer-term need (no immediate deadline)
- Languages: English (for immigrants to US/Canada), etc.

### NOT Your ICP (Politely Decline)

- Test takers (JLPT, AP Spanish, etc.)
- Casual tourists (just want to order coffee)
- Duolingo grinders (motivated by streaks/points)
- "I might learn [language] someday" (no urgency)
- Business professionals (transactional, not relational)

## Communication Tone Guide

### For USJC Members Going to Pilot (Not Core PAB)

**DON'T SAY**:
- "You weren't selected for Core PAB"
- "Core PAB is more important"
- "Sorry, we went with other people"

**DO SAY**:
- "I'm organizing a special USJC partnership"
- "Given the amazing response from USJC, I wanted to create a cohort experience"
- "This is a different level of involvement, but equally valuable"
- "You'll have your own community with other USJC members"
- "If you want to join Core PAB later, there's always flexibility"

### For Core PAB Members

**DON'T SAY**:
- "You were chosen over others"
- "You're the best candidates"

**DO SAY**:
- "You're an ideal fit for this group"
- "Your [specific situation] is exactly who Kaiwa is built for"
- "Your perspective will add important diversity"

### For Everyone

**ALWAYS**:
- Be warm and grateful
- Acknowledge their time and interest
- Be clear about time commitment

## Red Flags During Selection

Watch out for these signals that someone might not be a good fit:

**Survey Red Flags**:
- Can't articulate why they want to learn the language
- No specific deadline or upcoming event (for Core PAB)
- Answers suggest they want gamification/points
- Focused on grammar drills or test scores
- "I'll try to make time" (not committed)
- Interested only because friends are doing it

**Communication Red Flags**:
- Doesn't respond to survey or messages
- Vague or unenthusiastic responses
- Asks about payment (Core PAB members shouldn't expect to be paid)
- Demands specific features before even trying the product

**If You See Red Flags**:
- It's okay to politely decline or suggest they join after public launch
- Use "Thank You, But Not Right Now" template
- Don't force it—quality > quantity for PAB

## FAQ for You (The Founder)

**Q: What if I don't get enough Core PAB candidates from current pool?**

A: Recruit strategically to fill diversity gaps:
- Need Spanish heritage speaker? Post in r/Spanish or Hispanic heritage groups
- Need expat learning Mandarin? Post in r/expats or r/Chineselanguage
- Target specific personas using ICP acquisition channels (see `icp-personas.md`)

**Q: What if someone from USJC is offended they're not in Core PAB?**

A: Use messaging from templates:
- Emphasize USJC cohort as "organizational partnership" (special, not lesser)
- Explain Core PAB needed diversity across orgs/languages
- Offer flexibility: "If you're super engaged, you can join Core PAB later"
- Point out benefits of USJC cohort (community, lighter commitment)

**Q: Can someone be in both Core PAB and USJC Pilot?**

A: No—pick one track per person to avoid confusion and manage time commitments.

**Q: What if I have 2 perfect candidates but only 1 spot?**

A: Prioritize based on:
1. Urgency (who has closer deadline?)
2. Diversity value (who adds more unique perspective?)
3. Phase 1 ICP alignment (Sofia > David > Jamie > Rosa)
4. Engagement quality (who's more likely to participate actively?)

**Q: When should I recruit more Core PAB members?**

A: If after initial selection you have <8 people in Core PAB:
- Fill to 8-10 total
- Prioritize personas you're missing (e.g., if no heritage speakers, recruit 2-3)
- Use ICP acquisition channels to find high-quality candidates

**Q: How do I handle friendships within USJC group?**

A: Be transparent and fair:
- Acknowledge: "I know many of you are friends"
- Explain: "I needed diversity across orgs, so I selected 2-3 from USJC for Core PAB"
- Normalize: "Both tracks are valuable—just different involvement levels"
- Respect: "If this doesn't work for you, I totally understand"

---

## Final Thoughts

**Remember**:
- This is YOUR Product Advisory Board—you set the criteria
- Quality > quantity (8 engaged people > 15 passive people)
- ICP alignment is critical (don't dilute with non-ICP members)
- Friendship dynamics are real—address them proactively with clear messaging
- Both tracks (Core PAB + USJC Pilot) are valuable for different reasons
- You can adjust as you go (move people between tracks, add/remove members)

**Your North Star**:
Build a PAB that represents your ICP and will give you honest, actionable feedback to make Kaiwa better for high-stakes language learners.

**You've got this!** 🚀

Use the templates, trust the process, and don't overthink it. Start with the survey, see who responds, and make decisions from there.
