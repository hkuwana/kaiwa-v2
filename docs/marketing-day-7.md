### Task 4: Practice Your Opening (15 min)

**Rehearse this out loud** (seriously, do it):

```
"Hey everyone! Thanks for joining.

I'm [your name], and I'm building Kaiwa to help people practice conversations they're actually afraid of - like this one.

Today we're going to practice the first 5 minutes of meeting your partner's Japanese parents. That's the hardest part, right? The moment you walk in the door.

By the end of today, you'll have:
• The exact phrases to use
• Practiced them in a safe space
• Personalized advice for your situation
• More confidence that you can actually do this

This is judgment-free. We're all learning. The point is practice, not perfection.

Sound good? Let's start with quick intros..."
```

**Say this out loud 2-3 times so it feels natural.**

---

### Task 5: Mental Prep (15 min)

**Reminder to yourself**:

- You don't need to be perfect
- You're facilitating, not lecturing
- Their success is your success
- It's okay to say "I don't know, but let's figure it out"
- This is practice for YOU too

**Take 5 minutes**: Go for a walk, stretch, breathe.

---

## Afternoon Block (60-90 min): The Practice Lab Session

### During the Session: Key Tips

**1. Start on time** (don't wait for latecomers)

**2. Make it conversational**, not a lecture

- Ask questions: "Has anyone experienced this?"
- Get people talking to each other
- Share stories and examples

**3. Read the room**

- If people are quiet, that's okay - don't force participation
- If someone is dominating, gently redirect: "Great question! Let's hear from others too."
- If energy is low, take a 2-minute break

**4. Take notes during the session**

- What questions came up multiple times?
- What advice resonated most?
- What was confusing?
- Any testimonial-worthy moments?

**5. End with gratitude**

- Thank them for trusting you with their time
- Remind them: "You've got this. You're more prepared than you think."

## Evening Block (90 min): Follow-Up & Documentation

### Task 6: Immediate Follow-Up Email (20 min)

**Send within 1 hour of the session ending**:

**Subject**: "Thanks for today + your practice materials"

```

### Task 8: Request Testimonials (20 min)

**Send personalized DMs** to 2-3 participants who seemed most engaged:

```
Hey [Name]!

Thanks again for joining today's Practice Lab.

I noticed [specific thing they said or did that was great].

Quick ask: If today's session was valuable to you, would you mind sharing a quick testimonial I could use?

Something simple like:
• What were you worried about before?
• What helped most from the session?
• How do you feel now?

Could be a text response, voice note, or even short video (if you're comfortable).

No pressure at all - but it would really help me show others what these sessions are about.

Thanks!
```

---

### Task 9: Social Proof Post (20 min)

**LinkedIn Post**:

```
Just finished my first Practice Lab.

5 people preparing to meet their partner's Japanese parents.

Here's what happened:

**Before**: "I'm terrified I'll freeze and embarrass myself."

**During**: 45 minutes of safe, judgment-free practice.

**After**: "I actually feel like I can do this now."

One participant said: "I've been using Duolingo for 2 years. This 45-minute session was more valuable than all of that for this specific conversation."

That's the gap I'm trying to close with Kaiwa:
• Not learning "everything"
• Learning the RIGHT thing for the moment that matters to YOU

Thank you to everyone who trusted me with their time today.

Next session: Next Saturday. DM me if you want in.

Building in public, Day 7.

#buildinginpublic #languagelearning #kaiwa
```

**Action**: Post this on LinkedIn and Twitter.

## Copy-Paste Scripts for Today

### If someone says "This was SO helpful!"

```
I'm so glad! That makes all the preparation worth it.

Quick ask: Would you be comfortable sharing that as a testimonial? Just a sentence or two about what helped most.

It would really help others understand what these sessions are about.

Also - DM me after your actual meeting! I want to hear how it goes.
```

### If someone asks about Kaiwa

```
Kaiwa is what I'm building for exactly this - a way to practice high-stakes conversations before they happen.

Right now I'm in early stages, learning directly from sessions like today what people actually need.

Would you be interested in trying it out when it's ready? I'm looking for early users who can give feedback.
```

### If someone can't attend last minute

```
No worries at all! Life happens.

I'm running another one next Saturday. Would that work better?

Or if you want, I can send you the materials and we can do a quick 15-min 1-on-1 practice sometime this week.

Just let me know what's helpful!
```

## Reflection Questions

1. How did the session go overall?
2. What surprised you?
3. What would you change for next time?
4. Did anyone have a breakthrough moment?
