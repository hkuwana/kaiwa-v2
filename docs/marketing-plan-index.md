## 🎓 Philosophy Behind This Plan

This plan is based on your existing Kaiwa strategy documents:

1. **Value First**: Every post provides real value before asking for anything
2. **Building in Public**: Share your journey, not just wins
3. **Relationship-Driven**: Focus on deep connections with 10-20 people, not reach
4. **Persona-Led**: Start with Sofia (Bilingual Spouse), expand to David (Heritage Speaker)
5. **Practice Labs**: Free weekly sessions are your conversion engine
6. **Story-Based**: Case files and testimonials > feature lists
7. **Sustainable**: Systems that work for solo founder (2-3 hrs/day)

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do's

✅ **Do** respond to EVERY comment and DM
✅ **Do** host Practice Labs even if only 2 people show up
✅ **Do** document everything (you'll want these stories later)
✅ **Do** ask for testimonials immediately after positive feedback
✅ **Do** focus on one platform at a time if overwhelmed
✅ **Do** take days off (this is a marathon, not a sprint)

### Don'ts

❌ **Don't** skip the reflection questions (they're crucial)
❌ **Don't** aim for perfection (done > perfect)
❌ **Don't** spam or astroturf (value first, always)
❌ **Don't** try to do everything (pick what feels right to YOU)
❌ **Don't** ignore feedback (your users are telling you what to build)
❌ **Don't** forget to celebrate small wins

## 🚨 If You're Feeling Overwhelmed

This plan is comprehensive, but **you don't have to do everything**.

### Minimum Viable Marketing (MVM):

If you only have 1 hour per day:

**Monday-Friday** (45 min/day):

- 15 min: Respond to all comments/DMs
- 30 min: Create 1 piece of content (Reddit comment, video, or email)

**Saturday** (2 hours):

- Host Practice Lab

**Sunday** (30 min):

- Review metrics and plan next week

**That's it.** The rest is optimization.

### Start Here if Unsure:

1. Read Day 1 completely
2. Do Day 1 tasks
3. Review how it felt
4. Adjust Day 2 based on your energy
5. Keep going

You'll find your rhythm by Week 2.

---

## 🎯 Your North Star

Keep this visible throughout your 30 days:

> **"Help people have the ONE conversation they're afraid of."**

Every piece of content, every Practice Lab, every interaction should support this mission.

If something doesn't serve this goal, don't do it.
