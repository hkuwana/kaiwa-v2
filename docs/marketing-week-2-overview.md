## Day 9: Video Testimonials & TikTok Series

**Afternoon** (90 min):

- Create TikTok series: "Things nobody tells you about meeting partner's parents"
  - Video 1: "The gift matters more than you think"
  - Video 2: "They're testing your sincerity, not your grammar"
  - Video 3: "What to do when you don't understand"

**Evening** (30 min):

**Copy-Paste Video Script** (Video 1):

```
Things nobody tells you about meeting your Japanese partner's parents #1:

The gift (お土産) matters MORE than your Japanese level.

Here's why:
• It shows you understand reciprocity (important in Japanese culture)
• It gives them something to talk about (takes pressure off you)
• It shows you prepared and took this seriously

What to bring:
✅ Something from YOUR home city/country
✅ Something they can share (cookies, tea, local snack)
✅ Wrap it nicely (presentation matters)

❌ Don't bring: alcohol (unless you know they drink), something super expensive (creates obligation), nothing at all

The gift is your opening move. Get it right.

3. The Insight: People need practice for specific moments, not general fluency

6. Building in Public: What I'm learning (invite feedback)
```

- Create "Ask Me Anything" style post:

**Reddit AMA Post Template**:

```
Title: I've helped 20+ people prepare to meet their partner's parents in another language - AMA

Body:
Hi r/LearnJapanese,

I've spent the last month working with people preparing for one of the scariest language moments: meeting your partner's family for the first time.

I've noticed patterns in what people are afraid of, what actually helps, and what makes the difference between awkward silence and genuine connection.

Some context:
• I built this because I couldn't talk to my own Japanese grandparents
• I run free practice sessions every Saturday
• I'm building Kaiwa to help people practice high-stakes conversations

Ask me anything about:
• How to prepare for the meeting
• What parents are actually looking for
• How to handle when you don't understand
• Cultural tips that matter
• How to practice effectively

I'll answer every question!
```

**Evening** (30 min):

- Respond to EVERY comment on your AMA
- Document common questions for future content

---

## Day 12: User Research & Product Insight

**Morning** (60 min):

- Schedule 3 one-on-one calls with users for next week
- Send research interview questions in advance

**Research Questions to Ask**:

1. Walk me through your situation - what conversation are you preparing for?
2. What have you tried so far? What worked? What didn't?
3. On a scale of 1-10, how confident do you feel right now?
4. What would make you feel 100% prepared?
5. If Kaiwa could do ONE thing for you, what would it be?
6. How much would you pay for something that solved this completely?

**Afternoon** (90 min):

- Create detailed comparison content: "Kaiwa vs Duolingo vs Human Tutor vs Language Exchange"

**Comparison Framework**:

```
| Feature | Duolingo | Human Tutor | Language Exchange | Kaiwa |
|---------|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| Cost | Free | $25-50/hr | Free | $19/mo |
| Specific scenarios | ❌ | ✅ (if you find the right tutor) | ❌ | ✅ |

| 24/7 availability | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Judgment-free | ✅ | 50/50 | ❌ | ✅ |

## Key Copy-Paste Templates for Week 2

### For Practice Lab Follow-Up:

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for making Practice Lab #2 great!

Quick question: Would you be open to a quick 15-min call this week?

I'd love to hear:
• How the practice helped (or didn't)
• What you're still worried about
• What would make Kaiwa more valuable for you

Your feedback literally shapes what I build.

Available times: [list 3-4 options]

Let me know!
```

### For Video Comments:

```
Yes! This is exactly what I'm trying to solve with Kaiwa.

What's YOUR situation? What conversation are you preparing for?

I run free practice sessions on Saturdays if you want to rehearse it before the real thing.

DM me if you're interested!
```

### For "How much does this cost?" Questions:

```
Right now I'm offering free practice sessions while I build Kaiwa (in exchange for feedback).

Later pricing will likely be $19/month with a commitment model (practice 8x/month, document 1 real conversation, get money back).

But for now: free if you help me understand what you need.

Want to try a session?
```

**Next Week**: Week 3 focuses on scaling, creating more case files, and turning testimonials into compelling social proof that drives signups.
