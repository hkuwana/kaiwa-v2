## Platform-Specific Strategy

### Reddit Strategy (40% of your time)

**Why Reddit first**: Your ideal customers are ACTIVELY searching for help here.

**Daily tasks**:
- Morning: Find 2 threads in your target subreddits
- Evening: Post 2 thoughtful comments (200-300 words each)

**Weekly tasks**:
- 1 long-form case file post (Week 2, 3, 4)
- 1 AMA-style post (Week 3 or 4)

**Value ratio**: 10:1 (helpful:promotional)
- Days 1-14: Pure value, ZERO promotion
- Days 15-21: Mention Practice Lab if relevant
- Days 22-28: Mention beta if asked

**Templates to use**:
- See original Day 1, 2, 4, 6 for Reddit comment templates
- All templates work - just copy/paste and customize

---

### Instagram Reels Strategy (30% of your time)

**Why IG**: Best for storytelling + building personal brand

**Content types**:
- **Week 1**: Educational (3 phrases, tips, what not to say)
- **Week 2**: Stories (case files, behind-the-scenes)
- **Week 3**: Testimonials (social proof)
- **Week 4**: Conversion (beta launch, founding member benefits)

**Engagement strategy**:
- Respond to EVERY comment in first hour
- Use "Reply with video" feature (boosts engagement)
- Post Stories 3-4x per week:
  - Behind-the-scenes filming
  - Reddit comment screenshots
  - Quick tips
  - Practice Lab announcements

**Hashtag strategy** (use saved groups from Day 0):
- 2-3 big hashtags (#languagelearning #japanese)
- 2-3 medium (#bilingualcouple #learnJapanese)
- 2-3 niche (#meetingtheparents #languageanxiety)

**Best times**: 6-9am, 12-2pm, 7-9pm (test and track)

---

### TikTok Strategy (30% of your time)

**Why TikTok**: Fastest organic reach, best for going viral

**Content approach**:
- **Same videos as Instagram** (just cross-post)
- But TikTok favors:
  - Faster pace (30-45 seconds max)
  - More casual/authentic
  - Trends and sounds

**Engagement strategy**:
- Reply to comments with videos (huge for algorithm)
- Duet/Stitch other language learners' videos
- Use trending sounds (but keep your message)

**TikTok-specific tactics**:
- Go live on Saturday (Practice Lab preview or recap)
- Use text-to-speech for accessibility
- Post at high-traffic times: 6-9am, 7-11pm

**Pinned comment template**:
```

## Quick Win Tactics

### Reddit Quick Wins
- **Be first**: Sort by "New" not "Hot" (less competition)
- **Long comments win**: 200+ words > short replies
- **Ask questions**: End comments with "What's your situation?" (drives replies)
- **Update your comments**: If you get replies, edit your comment to add more value

### Instagram Quick Wins
- **Reply with video**: Huge for engagement + reach
- **Pin best comment**: Shows social proof to new viewers
- **Use question stickers**: In Stories (drives DM conversations)
- **Share to Stories**: Reshare your Reels to Stories (double exposure)

### TikTok Quick Wins
- **Post at 7-9am**: Catches morning scroll
- **Use 3-5 hashtags only**: TikTok doesn't need 30
- **Reply to every comment**: First hour is critical
- **Duet yourself**: If a video does well, duet it with a follow-up

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My videos aren't getting views"

**Week 1-2**: 50-200 views is NORMAL
- Keep posting consistently
- Engage with others' content more
- Check: Are your hooks strong? (first 3 seconds)

**Week 3+**: Should see 500-2,000 views per video
- If not: Test different hooks
- Try different posting times
- Analyze what content gets saved/shared

### "Reddit comments getting downvoted"

**Check**:
- Are you being too salesy? (10:1 value ratio)
- Did you read subreddit rules?
- Is your comment generic or specific?
- Are you commenting too fast? (looks like spam)

**Fix**:
- Make comments MORE helpful
- Never mention Kaiwa unless asked
- Wait 5-10 min between comments

### "Not getting Practice Lab signups"

**Week 1-2**: 3-5 people is GOOD
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Ask for feedback after each session

**Week 3+**: Should see 5-10 per session
- If not: Improve your CTAs
- Make signup easier (link in bio)
- Share testimonials from previous labs

---

## When to Scale

### Add 4th platform when:
- [ ] You're consistently posting 7 days/week
- [ ] Videos getting 2,000+ views average
- [ ] Reddit comments driving DMs
- [ ] You have 2+ hours per day available
- [ ] You've validated pricing with 10+ customers

### Recommended 4th platform: **Email**
