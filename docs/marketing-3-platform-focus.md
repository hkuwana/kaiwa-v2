---

## Modified 30-Day Plan

### Week 1: Foundation

**Day 0 (SETUP)**: Do `marketing-day-0-platform-setup.md` completely

- Set up Later.com
- Create 5 videos and schedule them
- Join Reddit communities
- Create content templates

**Days 1-7**: Follow original Day 1-7 plan BUT:

**SKIP**:

- ❌ LinkedIn posts
- ❌ Twitter threads
- ❌ Medium articles
- ❌ Email marketing (add this in Week 3 if you want)

**FOCUS ON**:

- ✅ 1-2 Reddit comments per day (templates in original plans)
- ✅ 1 video per day (auto-scheduled from Day 0 batch)
- ✅ Engage with comments on your videos
- ✅ Saturday Practice Lab

**Time saved**: ~90 minutes per day

---

### Week 2: Content Machine

**Wednesday (Week 2)**: Film your second batch

**Use these topics** (walking video style with text/AI voiceover):

**Batch 2 Videos** (7 videos):

1. Walking through Tokyo: "They stopped translating for me..." (relationship communication breakdown)
2. Walking past families: "Your grandparents have maybe 2 years left..." (heritage language urgency)
3. Walking in busy area: "That moment your partner becomes the interpreter..." (loss of direct connection)
4. Walking alone: "I passed every test but couldn't say I love you..." (textbook vs real life)
5. Walking at sunset: "Love shouldn't need subtitles" (core message)
6. Walking through neighborhood: User success story quote with text overlay
7. Practice Lab recap (filmed Saturday) - behind the scenes walking to the session

**Format:** All shot as walking footage, add text overlay or AI voiceover with trending music

**Daily routine** (Days 8-14):

- ✅ Check auto-posted video
- ✅ Respond to ALL comments
- ✅ 1-2 Reddit threads per day
- ✅ Engage with 10 other creators
- ✅ Saturday: Practice Lab #2

**New this week**:

- **Case File #1**: Post on Reddit as long-form value post (Day 8)
  - Post full case file in r/LearnJapanese or r/relationships
  - NO external links in post body
  - Only mention Kaiwa if asked in comments

---

### Week 3: Social Proof Engine

**Wednesday (Week 3)**: Film batch 3 (testimonial-focused walking videos)

**Batch 3 Videos** (7 videos - all walking footage with text/voiceover):

1. Walking: Testimonial quote overlaid on screen with emotional music
2. Walking through relationship context: "2 weeks ago, [Name] couldn't apologize in Japanese..."
3. Walking past coffee shop: Different testimonial quote with uplifting music
4. Walking: "Before: relied on subtitles. After: had their first real conversation."
5. Walking: "The mistake? Treating it like a test instead of a conversation"
6. Walking at night: Another powerful user quote with ambient music
7. Walking to Practice Lab location with behind-the-scenes narrative

**Key:** Emotional authenticity > production quality. Justin said female-leaning audience will "make TikToks organically about your product"

**Daily routine** (Days 15-21):

- Same as Week 2
- Add: Post testimonial graphics on IG Stories

**New this week**:

- **Case File #2**: Different persona (David - heritage speaker)

  - Repurpose for IG carousel (10 slides)

**Reddit focus**:

---

### Week 4: Conversion

**Wednesday (Week 4)**: Film batch 4 (beta launch walking videos)

**Batch 4 Videos** (7 videos - walking footage, conversion focused):

1. Walking confidently: "Opening 10 founding member spots" with text overlay
2. Walking: "Unlimited practice. Forever. $14/month locked in. Direct access to me."
3. Walking: User testimonial with their quote + before/after their situation
4. Walking: "Your partner's parents. Next month. You ready?" (urgency)
5. Walking: Different user success story quote overlaid
6. Walking faster/urgently: "3 spots left. Link in bio. Saturday deadline."
7. Walking into Practice Lab #4 with celebration energy

## Platform-Specific Strategy

### Reddit Strategy (40% of your time)

**Why Reddit first**: Your ideal customers are ACTIVELY searching for help here.

**Daily tasks**:

- Morning: Find 2 threads in your target subreddits
- Evening: Post 2 thoughtful comments (200-300 words each)

**Weekly tasks**:

- 1 long-form case file post (Week 2, 3, 4)
- 1 AMA-style post (Week 3 or 4)

**Value ratio**: 10:1 (helpful:promotional)

- Days 1-14: Pure value, ZERO promotion
- Days 15-21: Mention Practice Lab if relevant
- Days 22-28: Mention beta if asked

**Templates to use**:

- See original Day 1, 2, 4, 6 for Reddit comment templates
- All templates work - just copy/paste and customize

---

### Instagram Reels Strategy (30% of your time)

**Why IG**: Best for storytelling + building personal brand. Female-leaning platform (60-70% women per Justin) who are willing to pay and tell friends.

**NEW CONTENT APPROACH - Walking Videos:**

- **Week 1**: Emotional problem/solution (walking in Japan with text overlay about relationship language struggles)
- **Week 2**: Deeper storytelling (more walking footage, user stories with AI voiceover)
- **Week 3**: Social proof (walking with testimonial quotes overlaid)
- **Week 4**: Conversion (walking videos with urgency messaging)

**Why this works (from Justin's experience with Cali):**

- "My best downloading creative was just... walking down the street saying like my life changed when I started talking to my AI therapist with Bad Bunny's song over it"
- Simple, authentic, relatable
- Girls "are going to practice every day. They're going to tell their friends. They're going to make TikToks organically about your product"

**Engagement strategy**:

- Respond to EVERY comment in first hour
- Use "Reply with video" feature (boosts engagement)
- Post Stories 3-4x per week:
  - Behind-the-scenes filming
  - Reddit comment screenshots
  - Quick tips
  - Practice Lab announcements

**Hashtag strategy** (use saved groups from Day 0):

- 2-3 big hashtags (#languagelearning #japanese)
- 2-3 medium (#bilingualcouple #learnJapanese)
- 2-3 niche (#meetingtheparents #languageanxiety)

**Best times**: 6-9am, 12-2pm, 7-9pm (test and track)

---

### TikTok Strategy (30% of your time)

**Why TikTok**: Fastest organic reach, best for going viral. Justin's "Asian feed audience" is 60-70% female, exactly your target.

**Content approach**:

- **Same walking videos as Instagram** (cross-post)
- TikTok LOVES this format:
  - Walking POV content performs incredibly well
  - Faster pace (30-45 seconds max) ✓
  - Casual/authentic (no fancy setup) ✓
  - Trending sounds with emotional text overlay ✓
  - Relationship-focused content = high engagement from female audience

**Engagement strategy**:

- Reply to comments with videos (huge for algorithm)
- Duet/Stitch other language learners' videos
- Use trending sounds (but keep your message)

**TikTok-specific tactics**:

- Go live on Saturday (Practice Lab preview or recap)
- Use text-to-speech for accessibility
- Post at high-traffic times: 6-9am, 7-11pm

**Pinned comment template**:

```

Then actually DM everyone who comments "GUIDE" with your prep guide PDF.

## Content Batching Templates

### Wednesday Filming Checklist

> **NEW SIMPLIFIED APPROACH**: Walking videos in Japan with AI voiceover/text overlay (based on Justin's recommendation and Cali's proven success)

**Setup** (5 min):

- [ ] Phone ready (hold in hand or use gimbal - no tripod needed!)
- [ ] Scout 2-3 interesting walking locations in Japan
- [ ] Wear something casual and authentic
- [ ] No need for perfect lighting - natural outdoor light works

**Filming** (30-45 min):

- [ ] Walk naturally in 5-7 different locations (streets, parks, stations, neighborhoods)
- [ ] Film yourself from behind/side angle (more authentic than facing camera)
- [ ] Get 1-2 min of footage per location
- [ ] Film vertical (9:16 format)
- [ ] Don't perform - just walk like you normally would

**Editing** (45 min - faster than before!):

- [ ] Import to CapCut
- [ ] Trim each clip to 30-45 seconds (keep best walking parts)
- [ ] Add trending music from CapCut library
- [ ] Choose your style:
  - **Text overlay**: Add text line by line, synced to music (easier, tested by Cali)
  - **AI voiceover**: Use CapCut text-to-speech + subtle music (more engaging)
- [ ] Export all

**Scheduling** (30 min):

- [ ] Upload all to Later
- [ ] Schedule 1 per day for next 7 days
- [ ] Write captions (use templates)
- [ ] Add hashtag groups
- [ ] Set to post to both IG + TikTok

**Total**: 2 hours once per week = 7 days of content (30 min faster than before!)

**Why this works better:**

- More authentic (not "performing")
- Faster to film (just walk!)
- Matches platform native content
- Proven by Cali's best performing creative
- Female-leaning audience responds to emotional storytelling

## Quick Win Tactics

### Reddit Quick Wins

- **Be first**: Sort by "New" not "Hot" (less competition)
- **Long comments win**: 200+ words > short replies
- **Ask questions**: End comments with "What's your situation?" (drives replies)
- **Update your comments**: If you get replies, edit your comment to add more value

### Instagram Quick Wins

- **Reply with video**: Huge for engagement + reach
- **Pin best comment**: Shows social proof to new viewers
- **Use question stickers**: In Stories (drives DM conversations)
- **Share to Stories**: Reshare your Reels to Stories (double exposure)

### TikTok Quick Wins

- **Post at 7-9am**: Catches morning scroll
- **Use 3-5 hashtags only**: TikTok doesn't need 30
- **Reply to every comment**: First hour is critical
- **Duet yourself**: If a video does well, duet it with a follow-up

---

## Troubleshooting

### "My videos aren't getting views"

**Week 1-2**: 50-200 views is NORMAL

- Keep posting consistently
- Engage with others' content more
- Check: Are your hooks strong? (first 3 seconds)

**Week 3+**: Should see 500-2,000 views per video

- If not: Test different hooks
- Try different posting times
- Analyze what content gets saved/shared

### "Reddit comments getting downvoted"

**Check**:

- Are you being too salesy? (10:1 value ratio)
- Did you read subreddit rules?
- Is your comment generic or specific?
- Are you commenting too fast? (looks like spam)

**Fix**:

- Make comments MORE helpful
- Never mention Kaiwa unless asked
- Wait 5-10 min between comments

### "Not getting Practice Lab signups"

**Week 1-2**: 3-5 people is GOOD

- Focus on quality over quantity
- Ask for feedback after each session

**Week 3+**: Should see 5-10 per session

- If not: Improve your CTAs
- Make signup easier (link in bio)
- Share testimonials from previous labs

---

## When to Scale

### Add 4th platform when:

- [ ] You're consistently posting 7 days/week
- [ ] Videos getting 2,000+ views average
- [ ] Reddit comments driving DMs
- [ ] You have 2+ hours per day available
- [ ] You've validated pricing with 10+ customers

### Recommended 4th platform: **Email**

- Converts better than social

- Sets up for Week 5+ growth
