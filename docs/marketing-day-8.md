## Morning Block (60 min): Testimonial Gathering

### Task 1: Follow Up with Practice Lab Participants (30 min)

**Check your email** for feedback responses from yesterday's follow-up.

**If someone responded positively**, send this:

```
Thank you so much for the kind words!

Would you be comfortable if I shared this as a testimonial? I can:
• Keep it anonymous (just "Sarah, 28" or "Bilingual couple preparing to meet parents")
• Use your first name only
• Use your full name + LinkedIn (if you're comfortable)

Your call - whatever you're comfortable with!

Also, when is your actual meeting happening? I'd love to hear how it goes afterward!
```

---

### Task 2: Create a Testimonial Request Form (30 min)

**Use Google Forms or Typeform** to create a simple testimonial collection form.

**Questions to include**:

1. **What was your situation?** (Open text)
2. **What were you most worried about before the Practice Lab?** (Open text)
3. **What was most helpful from the session?** (Open text)
4. **How do you feel now about your upcoming conversation?** (Scale 1-10 + comment)
5. **Would you recommend this to someone in a similar situation?** (Yes/No + why)
6. **Can we share your feedback?** (Anonymous / First name only / Full name)

# Case File #1: How Maria Prepared to Meet Takeshi's Parents

**Published**: [Date]
**Reading time**: 3 minutes

---

## The Situation

Maria had been dating Takeshi for 18 months. His parents were visiting from Osaka in 3 weeks. Her Japanese level: N4 (basic conversations, but not fluent).

Her text to me: "I'm terrified. What if they think I'm not good enough for him?"

---

## The Fear

Like most people in her situation, Maria wasn't actually afraid of the LANGUAGE.

She was afraid of:
• Being judged as "not serious" about the relationship
• Not being able to express how much she loves him
• Embarrassing Takeshi in front of his family
• The parents thinking she's "just another American who won't try"

Sound familiar?

---

## The Preparation

We focused on 3 things:

### 1. The First 5 Minutes

This is the hardest part. Walking in the door, giving the gift, first impressions.

We practiced:
• The greeting (with proper bowing)
• Gift presentation (お土産)
• The opening line: "いつもTakeshiさんにお世話になっています"

Not "My Japanese is good" (sounds arrogant).
But "Thank you for raising Takeshi so well."

### 2. Common Questions

We prepared answers for:
• "What do you do for work?"
• "Do you like Japanese food?"
• "What are your plans together?"

Short, sincere answers. Not essays.

### 3. Recovery Phrases

What to say when you DON'T understand:
• "もう一度お願いします" (Could you repeat that?)
• "ゆっくり話していただけますか" (Could you speak slowly?)

And the nuclear option: A smile and "日本語がまだ難しいです" (Japanese is still difficult for me).

---

## The Breakthrough Moment

In our third practice session, something clicked.

Maria stopped translating in her head. She stopped trying to find the "perfect" word.

She said: "I just... FELT the words instead of thinking about them."

That's the shift. From performing to connecting.

---

## The Result

The meeting happened last weekend.

Maria texted me after: "I did it. They understood me. His mom held my hand and said something I didn't fully understand, but I FELT it was kind. I cried happy tears."

Takeshi told her later what his mom said: "She has a good heart. We can tell."

---

## The Key Insight

Perfect grammar doesn't build bridges. Sincere effort does.

Takeshi's parents didn't care that Maria sometimes struggled with particles or forgot the humble form of a verb.

They cared that she:
• Showed up prepared
• Made an effort to speak THEIR language
• Showed respect and gratitude
• Was genuine in her nervousness

Language isn't about perfection. It's about connection.

---

## If You're in Maria's Shoes

Maybe you're preparing for the same conversation.

Maybe your partner's family speaks Korean, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic.

Maybe it's not "meeting the parents" - maybe it's:
• Apologizing after a fight
• Sharing big news (engagement, pregnancy, moving)
• Having a difficult conversation about the future

The fear is the same.
The preparation is the same.
The breakthrough is the same.

**You don't need 1000 words. You need the RIGHT 10 words.**

And you need to practice them in a safe space before the real moment.

## Copy-Paste Scripts for Today

### Response to "This is exactly my situation!"

```
Then you know the fear is real!

When is your meeting happening?

I'd love to help you prepare. Next Practice Lab is Saturday, or we can do a quick 1-on-1 session if you need something before then.

What's your biggest worry about the meeting?
```

### Response to "How can I practice this on my own?"

```
Great question! Here's what works:

1. **Script it out**: Write your introduction + answers to 3 common questions
2. **Say it out loud**: 10x per day minimum. In the shower, in the car, wherever
3. **Record yourself**: Listen back - you'll catch where you sound unnatural
4. **Get feedback**: Practice Lab on Saturday, or DM me a voice note and I'll give you feedback

The key is PRACTICING, not just reading. Your mouth needs to know the words.

Want me to send you the full prep guide?
```

### Response to "Do you offer 1-on-1 sessions?"

```
Yes! Right now I'm offering them free while building Kaiwa (in exchange for feedback).

Later they'll be $49 for a 45-min session, but early supporters get free access.

When is your conversation happening? Let's find a time to practice.

DM me with:
• Your situation
• Your timeline
• Your biggest worry
```
