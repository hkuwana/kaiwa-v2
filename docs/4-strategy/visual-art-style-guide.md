# Visual Art Style Guide

> **Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS DEFINITION
> **Last Updated**: 2025-12-01
> **Priority**: Medium

## Purpose

Define a consistent visual art style for Kaiwa that:

- Works across all features (scenarios, characters, UI elements)
- Feels welcoming and approachable for language learners
- Is scalable and cost-effective to produce
- Aligns with brand identity and target audience

---

## Current State

### ✅ Completed Implementations

- Ghibli-style characters (implemented, now archived)
- Basic scenario thumbnails system

### ⚠️ Needs Consistency

Currently, visual elements lack a unified style across:

- Scenario thumbnails
- Character representations
- UI illustrations
- Marketing materials
- Learning path visuals

---

## Action Items

### 1. Define Core Visual Style

**Questions to Answer**:

- What emotional tone should the visuals convey? (e.g., warm, playful, professional, minimalist)
- Who is the target aesthetic audience? (e.g., young professionals, students, families)
- What are 3-5 reference brands/apps with similar visual style?
- Should we use illustrations, photography, or a mix?

**Deliverable**: Visual mood board with 10-15 reference examples

---

### 2. Establish Style Elements

**To Define**:

- **Color Palette**: Primary, secondary, accent colors (beyond brand colors)
- **Illustration Style**:
  - Line weight and style (bold, thin, sketchy, clean)
  - Level of detail (simple, detailed, semi-realistic)
  - Shading approach (flat, gradient, textured)
- **Character Design**:
  - Proportions and anatomy style
  - Expression approach (realistic, exaggerated, minimal)
  - Diversity representation guidelines
- **Compositional Approach**:
  - Layout principles
  - Negative space usage
  - Typography pairing

**Deliverable**: Style guide document with visual examples

---

### 3. Consider Implementation Options

**In-House Options**:

- Midjourney/DALL-E with consistent prompts and style parameters
- Figma templates with reusable components
- SVG icon libraries with custom modifications

**External Options**:

- Hire a freelance illustrator to create a base library
- Commission a style guide from a design agency
- Use stock illustration services (e.g., undraw.co, humaaans.com)
- Purchase illustration packs that match our style

**Budget Considerations**:

- Initial investment: $X,XXX for base style guide + library
- Ongoing: $XXX/month for new assets

---

### 4. Create Asset Library

**Initial Assets Needed**:

- 10-20 character variations (diverse ages, ethnicities, professions)
- 20-30 scenario backgrounds/settings
- 50+ icon set for common UI elements
- 10+ illustrations for empty states, onboarding, etc.

**Organization**:

- Centralized asset repository (e.g., Figma library, cloud storage)
- Naming convention for easy discovery
- Versioning and update process
- Usage guidelines for team members

---

### 5. Document Usage Guidelines

**To Include**:

- When to use which style elements
- How to request new assets
- Dos and don'ts (examples of good/bad usage)
- Accessibility considerations (color contrast, alt text)
- File format standards

---

## Style Direction Ideas (To Evaluate)

### Option A: Warm Minimalist

**Inspiration**: Duolingo, Headspace

- Friendly, approachable illustrations
- Limited color palette with pops of accent colors
- Simple shapes, clean lines
- Emphasizes clarity and calmness

**Pros**: Timeless, accessible, easy to produce consistently
**Cons**: May feel generic if not differentiated

---

### Option B: Hand-Drawn & Personal

**Inspiration**: Notion, FigJam

- Slightly imperfect, sketchy line work
- Feels handcrafted and warm
- Playful and creative
- Personal touch

**Pros**: Distinctive, memorable, conveys care
**Cons**: Harder to maintain consistency, may age poorly

---

### Option C: Geometric & Modern

**Inspiration**: Stripe, Webflow

- Bold shapes and patterns
- High contrast, vibrant colors
- Clean and professional
- Modern and tech-forward

**Pros**: Professional, scalable, on-trend
**Cons**: May feel cold or intimidating for language learners

---

### Option D: Cultural Fusion

**Inspiration**: Mix of international art styles

- Incorporates visual elements from different cultures
- Celebrates diversity and global connection
- Unique and ownable
- Tells a story about language learning

**Pros**: Unique, meaningful, inclusive
**Cons**: Complex to execute, risk of appropriation if done poorly

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Target feeling**: When a user sees Kaiwa visuals, what should they feel? (excited? calm? confident?)
2. **Differentiation**: What makes our visual style uniquely "Kaiwa"?
3. **Scalability**: Can we maintain this style as we grow?
4. **Cultural sensitivity**: How do we represent diverse cultures respectfully?
5. **Budget**: What's realistic for our current stage?

## Success Metrics

**We'll know this is working when**:

- New team members can identify "Kaiwa-style" visuals without labels
- Users associate our visual style with our brand (recognition)
- We can produce new assets quickly without quality loss
- Visual consistency across all touchpoints (app, web, marketing)
- Positive user feedback on visual appeal
