# Marketing Week 1-2: PAB Setup Focus (Modified Plan)

**Context**: You already have 13-14 interested candidates for your Product Advisory Board. This is WAY ahead of the original marketing plan's Week 1 target of "10 warm leads."

**Strategic Shift**: Instead of spending 2-3 hours/day on Reddit/TikTok/LinkedIn content creation, focus on:

1. **Week 1**: PAB recruitment, selection, and onboarding (2-3 hours/day)
2. **Week 2**: PAB engagement + light external marketing (2-3 hours/day)
3. **Weeks 3-4**: Return to external marketing with PAB testimonials and insights

---

## Why This Makes Sense

**You're ahead of the curve**:

- Original plan Week 1 goal: 10 warm leads
- Your reality: 13-14 highly qualified candidates already
- Better to convert these 13 → 12 Core PAB members than chase 10 more strangers

**PAB will accelerate marketing**:

- Week 3-4: You'll have real testimonials from PAB
- Better content (real user stories vs theoretical)
- Social proof for external marketing
- Validated messaging based on PAB feedback

**Solo founder efficiency**:

- Don't split energy between PAB + external marketing
- Focus on one thing, do it well
- Build foundation before scaling

## What About Original Marketing Plan?

**Week 3-4: Transition Back to External Marketing**

Once you have:

- ✅ 10-12 Core PAB members engaged
- ✅ 2-3 testimonials collected
- ✅ Clear feature priorities from PAB feedback
- ✅ Beta product stabilized based on PAB input

THEN return to original marketing plan:

- **Week 3** (Days 15-21): Focus on Reddit, TikTok, case files (but now with REAL testimonials from PAB!)
- **Week 4** (Days 22-28): Beta launch to public, conversion, scaling

**Why This Sequence Works**:

1. Week 1-2: Build foundation with PAB
2. Week 3-4: Scale with social proof and validated messaging
3. PAB testimonials make external marketing 10x more effective
4. You'll know what resonates because PAB told you

---

## Time Allocation Summary

### Week 1 (PAB Setup)

- **Marketing/PAB**: 2-3 hours/day (survey, selection, onboarding)
- **Product**: 1-2 hours/day (fix bugs, prep beta access)
- **Total**: 3-5 hours/day

### Week 2 (PAB Engagement + Light Marketing)

- **PAB Engagement**: 1-2 hours/day (meetings, feedback, community)
- **External Marketing**: 1 hour/day (Reddit, LinkedIn, light content)
- **Product**: 2-3 hours/day (implement PAB feedback)
- **Total**: 4-6 hours/day

### Week 3-4 (Return to External Marketing)

- **Follow original marketing plan** (Days 15-28)
- **But with PAB testimonials and insights**
- **PAB becomes background** (monthly meetings, async feedback)

---

## Key Differences from Original Plan

### What You're SKIPPING in Week 1-2:

- ❌ Heavy Reddit/TikTok content creation (3-5 videos/week)
- ❌ Practice Lab hosting (you have PAB instead)
- ❌ Cold outreach on multiple platforms
- ❌ Daily content grind

### What You're DOING Instead:

- ✅ Converting 13-14 warm leads → 12 Core PAB members
- ✅ Building deep relationships with 12 high-quality users
- ✅ Collecting testimonials from real users (not strangers)
- ✅ Validating product with PAB before scaling marketing
- ✅ Light external marketing (Reddit comments, LinkedIn posts) to stay visible

### Why This Is Better for Your Situation:

- You already have quality leads (don't need to hunt for more)
- 12 engaged PAB members > 30 random warm leads
- Testimonials from PAB > theoretical case files
- Product feedback from PAB > guessing what to build
- Solo founder efficiency (focus on one thing at a time)

## If You Want to Do SOME External Marketing

**Minimum Viable External Marketing (Week 1-2)**:

**Daily (15-30 min)**:

- [ ] Post 1-2 helpful Reddit comments
- [ ] Respond to all DMs and comments

**3x per week (30 min each)**:

- [ ] LinkedIn/Twitter post about building in public
- [ ] Share a PAB insight or learning

**Weekly (1 hour)**:

- [ ] Write one long-form LinkedIn post or Medium article

**Total Time**: ~1 hour/day for external marketing
**Remaining Time**: PAB setup and product work

This keeps you visible without overwhelming your PAB focus.

---

## Decision Point: Week 3

**At end of Week 2, ask yourself**:

1. **Do I have 2-3 solid testimonials from PAB?**
   - YES → Ramp up external marketing in Week 3
   - NO → Extend PAB focus another week

2. **Is my product stable enough for public beta?**
   - YES → Start external marketing, accept new users
   - NO → Fix critical bugs before scaling

3. **Do I have capacity for external marketing?**
   - YES → Follow original plan Week 3-4
   - NO → Stay PAB-focused, scale later

Don't force external marketing until you have:

- ✅ Stable product
- ✅ Engaged PAB
- ✅ Real testimonials
- ✅ Clear messaging (validated by PAB)

---

## TL;DR

**Week 1**: Focus on PAB setup (survey → selection → onboarding)
**Week 2**: Focus on PAB engagement (first meeting → feedback → light external marketing)
**Week 3-4**: Return to original marketing plan WITH PAB testimonials and insights

**Why**: You already have 13-14 quality leads. Better to convert these → 12 engaged PAB members than chase strangers on Reddit/TikTok. PAB will give you testimonials and insights to make external marketing 10x more effective later.

**Time Saved**: ~10-15 hours in Week 1-2 (no heavy content creation)
**Time Invested**: Building foundation that makes Weeks 3-4 way more effective

**You're playing the long game. PAB first, scale second.**
