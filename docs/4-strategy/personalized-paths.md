# 🎯 Personalized Paths Strategy

> **Core Insight**: Users don't want to "learn a language." They want to achieve a specific outcome: talk to partner's mom, not embarrass themselves at dinner, stay in the loop when kids speak French. Personalized Paths deliver exactly that.

## FAQ

**Q: What if someone wants a language I don't speak?**
A: You don't need to speak it. You're designing the _scenarios_ and _progression_, not teaching grammar. AI handles the actual conversation.

**Q: What if someone doesn't complete the path?**
A: Check in at Day 3 and Day 7. If they're struggling, offer to adjust. Completion rate is a key metric.

**Q: How do I create scenarios quickly?**
A: Build templates. After 10 "Meet the Parents" paths, you'll have a template. Just swap names and specific situations.

**Q: Should I offer refunds?**
A: Yes, for founding members (goodwill). For paid users, offer to rebuild the path if it's not working, not a refund.

## 📋 Discovery Call Notes

### Todd Matsumoto - November 29, 2025

**User Profile:**

- **Name**: Todd Matsumoto
- **Languages**: Spanish, Japanese
- **Current Level**: Conversational (uses free conversation mode successfully)
- **Primary Goal**: Communicate with 95-year-old grandmother
- **Secondary Interest**: Emily (curiosity-driven learning)

**Use Case Deep Dive:**

**Primary: Elderly Family Communication (Grandmother)**

- **Who**: 95-year-old grandmother
- **Frequency**: Very frequent ("Communicate with his grandma frequently and a lot of stuff")
- **Context**: Caregiver/family support role
- **Specific Situations**:
  - Taking her to places (Place X and Place Y)
  - Explaining things to her caregivers/people around her
  - Reporting on family members to grandmother
  - Example: "Sister is in San Francisco and going to [somewhere]"
  - Providing updates on family activities and locations
- **Challenge**: "A lot of things that's not in the room" - abstract concepts, places not physically present

**What Worked:**

- ✅ Free conversation mode - unstructured practice suited his needs
- ✅ About page resonates - mission/branding connects emotionally
- ✅ No gamification needed - wants authentic conversation practice

**What Didn't Work:**

- ❌ Spanish: Speed escalation too fast ("tutor mode to super conversational speed real quick and felt overwhelming")
- ❌ Japanese: Overall pacing too fast ("It's too fast when she was doing Japanese")
- ❌ Input mode discovery: "Walkie talkie" mode wasn't findable
- ❌ Audio input mode visibility: "He didn't know audio input mode was there"
- ❌ Terminology confusion: "Manual control" vs "walkie talkie mode"
- ❌ Name insertion unclear: "Couldn't identify the part to insert name with things like 'my name is [your name]'"

**Feature Requests:**

- 🔄 Repetition for elderly learners: "Old people: Say it 3 times"
- 🎙️ Hands-free mode: "Hangout so while he's driving that he can talk"
- 📚 Vocabulary component: Visual reference during conversation
- ⌨️ Keyboard controls: Spacebar to talk, Enter confusion

**Personalized Path Opportunity:**

**Template: "Elderly Family Communication"**
**Target Persona**: Heritage Speaker (David) + Caregiver role
**Duration**: 2-4 weeks
**Unique Needs**:

- Slower pacing with repetition ("say it 3 times")
- Explaining abstract concepts (places, events not present)
- Bridging language for caregivers/medical professionals
- Family update conversations (reporting on relatives)

**Potential Scenario Structure:**

**Week 1: Basic Communication with Elderly Family**

- Day 1: Daily check-ins and greetings
- Day 2: Discussing meals and preferences
- Day 3: Talking about family members (who, where, what they're doing)
- Day 4: Explaining places you're taking them
- Day 5: Describing activities for the day
- Day 6: Communicating with caregivers/helpers
- Day 7: Review (full conversation simulation)

**Week 2: Complex Topics & Medical/Care Situations**

- Day 8: Medical appointments and health updates
- Day 9: Explaining family news and events
- Day 10: Discussing memories and past events
- Day 11: Coordinating with other family members
- Day 12: Emergency situations (doctor, medication, etc.)
- Day 13: Comfort and emotional support phrases
- Day 14: Final simulation (comprehensive care conversation)

**Cool Use Cases Mentioned:**

- Emily (curiosity-driven)
- Potential for driving/commute practice (hands-free need)

**Follow-Up Actions:**

- [ ] Reach out to offer personalized path (free for founding member)
- [ ] Focus on elderly communication + caregiver scenarios
- [ ] Highlight slower pacing with repetition features
- [ ] Consider this as template for elder care/heritage speaker segment

**Key Insights for Product:**

1. **Accessibility matters**: Speed control critical for different age groups/contexts
2. **Caregiver use case**: Untapped market (communicating FOR elderly relatives)
3. **Hands-free mode**: Important for multitasking caregivers (driving, cooking)
4. **Repetition > Gamification**: Older learners need reinforcement, not points
5. **Clear terminology**: "Walkie talkie" resonates more than "manual control"

**Persona Validation:**

- ✅ Heritage Speaker (David): Family-focused, practical communication needs
- ✅ New sub-persona: "Caregiver Communicator" - helping elderly family navigate language barriers
