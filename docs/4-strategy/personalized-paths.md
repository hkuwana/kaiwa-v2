# 🎯 Personalized Paths Strategy

> **Core Insight**: Users don't want to "learn a language." They want to achieve a specific outcome: talk to partner's mom, not embarrass themselves at dinner, stay in the loop when kids speak French. Personalized Paths deliver exactly that.

## What is a Personalized Path?

A custom 2-4 week scenario journey built specifically for ONE user's goal, based on a 15-minute discovery call.

**Example**: Chika wants to communicate with her French partner's mom and stay in the loop when they have kids.

Her Personalized Path:
```
Week 1: Basic mother-in-law conversations
  - Day 1: First meeting greetings
  - Day 2: Complimenting her cooking
  - Day 3: Talking about your work
  - Day 4: Asking about her son's childhood
  - Day 5: Phone call basics
  - Day 6: Saying goodbye warmly
  - Day 7: Review scenario (full dinner simulation)

Week 2: Deeper family conversations
  - Day 8: Discussing future plans
  - Day 9: Asking for advice (builds trust)
  - Day 10: Sharing good news
  - Day 11: Navigating disagreement gently
  - Day 12: Holiday/celebration vocabulary

## FAQ

**Q: What if someone wants a language I don't speak?**
A: You don't need to speak it. You're designing the *scenarios* and *progression*, not teaching grammar. AI handles the actual conversation.

**Q: What if someone doesn't complete the path?**
A: Check in at Day 3 and Day 7. If they're struggling, offer to adjust. Completion rate is a key metric.

**Q: How do I create scenarios quickly?**
A: Build templates. After 10 "Meet the Parents" paths, you'll have a template. Just swap names and specific situations.

**Q: Should I offer refunds?**
A: Yes, for founding members (goodwill). For paid users, offer to rebuild the path if it's not working, not a refund.
