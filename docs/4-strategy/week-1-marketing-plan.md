## Daily Plan

### Day 1 (Tuesday, Nov 26)

| Task | Planned | Actual | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| DM Robert (Japanese formal) | ⬜ | | |
| DM Chika (French partner's mom) | ⬜ | | |
| Fix analysis bug Robert reported | ⬜ | | |
| 1 X post (intro/what you're building) | ⬜ | | |

**Robert message:**
```
Hey Robert! Thanks for flagging that analysis bug - I'm fixing it today.

Quick question: You mentioned wanting to speak more confidently to
strangers and fill gaps in formal Japanese.

I'm testing something new - a personalized 2-week path where I build
you custom scenarios for exactly that. 15-min call, you tell me the
specific situations you struggle with, I create 14 daily scenarios.

For founding members like you, it's free - your feedback is worth
way more than money right now.

Want to try it? Here's my calendar: [link]
```

**Chika message:**
```
Hey Chika! Love your goal - communicating with your partner's mom
AND staying in the loop when you have French-speaking kids. That's
exactly what Kaiwa is built for.

I'm testing a new "Personalized Path" feature. Here's how it works:
- 15-min call where you tell me about your partner's mom, what
  situations come up, what you want to be able to say
- I build you 14 custom French scenarios (one per day)

For founding members, it's free. Want to try it?
Calendar: [link]
```

**X post idea:**
```
Building a language app but realized something:

Nobody wants to "learn Japanese."

They want to not embarrass themselves at dinner with their
girlfriend's parents next month.

So I'm testing "Personalized Paths" - custom scenarios built
for ONE person's specific situation.

Week 1 begins.
```

### Day 2 (Wednesday, Nov 27)

| Task | Planned | Actual | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|-------|
| DM Bri (Japan work/life) | ⬜ | | |
| DM Akemi (part-time Japan) | ⬜ | | |
| DM Scott (Spanish maintenance) | ⬜ | | |
| 1 Reddit comment (r/LearnJapanese or r/LongDistance) | ⬜ | | |

**Bri message:**
```
Hey Bri! Your feedback about beginner→intermediate being tough
is super valuable - that's a real gap I want to solve.

I have an idea: what if I built you a personalized 2-week path
that gradually increases difficulty? Starting where you're
comfortable, building up each day, specifically for work/life
in Japan scenarios.

15-min call to understand what situations you'd face, then 14
custom scenarios delivered daily.

Free for founding members. Want to try it?
Calendar: [link]

PS - Would love to hear about your Duolingo Max experience too!
```

**Akemi message:**
```
Hey Akemi! Thanks for catching that audio bug - super helpful.

You mentioned wanting to actually express yourself in Japanese,
not just scrape by with Google Translate. I felt that.

I'm testing "Personalized Paths" - 15-min call where you tell
me the specific situations you face in Japan (neighbors?
services? social?), and I build you 14 custom scenarios daily.

Free for founding members. Interested?
Calendar: [link]
```

**Scott message:**
```
Hey Scott! You called out two things I want to solve:
1. "I'm busy and need reminders"
2. "Somehow always loops back to cooking lol"

What if I built you a "Fluency Refresh" path:
- 5-minute daily scenarios (quick hits)
- Built-in variety (no more cooking spirals, I promise)
- I'll personally ping you with reminders

15-min call to learn what topics you want, then 14 custom scenarios.

Free for founding members. Down?

### Day 3 (Thursday, Nov 28 - Thanksgiving)

Grateful for the 5 people testing my language app right now.

Robert wants to speak formal Japanese to strangers.
Chika wants to talk to her partner's French mom.
Bri wants to work in Japan.
Akemi wants to live part-time in Japan.
Scott wants to maintain his Spanish.

5 different goals. 5 custom paths to build.

This is the fun part.

15 minutes. Learned:
- [Specific insight from the call]

Now building 14 custom scenarios for their exact situation.

This doesn't scale. That's the point.

| Any remaining discovery calls | ⬜ | | |
| 2-3 Reddit comments | ⬜ | | |
| Start thinking about first PAID path pitch | ⬜ | | |

---

## Week 1 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Founding member DMs sent | 5 | |
| Discovery calls booked | 3-5 | |
| Discovery calls completed | 2-3 | |
| Personalized paths created | 2-3 | |
| Reddit comments posted | 5-7 | |
| X posts published | 5-7 | |

---

## X Content Strategy

### What to Post (3-5x/week)

**Type 1: Build-in-Public Updates**
```
Week X update:
- [Metric]
- [Metric]
- [Learning]

What should I try next?
```

**Type 2: Founder Journey / Vulnerability**
```
I have $15 MRR.

Here's what I'm doing about it: [action]

Will report back.
```

**Type 3: User Insights (anonymized)**
```
Did a call with a user today.

They don't want to "learn French."

They want their partner's mom to stop switching to English
when they walk in the room.

Different problem. Different solution.
```

**Type 4: Hot Takes / Positioning**
```
Duolingo just added AI conversations.

But here's what they'll never do:

Build you a custom 2-week path for meeting your Korean
boyfriend's parents in 3 weeks.

Generic vs specific. That's the gap.
```

**Type 5: Personal Story**
```
I couldn't talk to my Japanese grandmother before she died.

That's why I'm building this.

Not for streaks. Not for points.

For the conversations that actually matter.
```

### What NOT to Post

- Product feature announcements (nobody cares yet)
- Generic language learning tips (not differentiated)
- Anything that sounds like marketing copy
- Complaints without action

### Best Times to Post

- Morning: 8-9am (catches commuters)
- Lunch: 12-1pm
- Evening: 6-8pm

Pick ONE time and be consistent.

## Blog/SEO/AEO/GEO - The Honest Take

### Skip for Now

**Traditional SEO**: Takes 3-6 months to see results. You need revenue NOW, not in 6 months.

**AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**: Optimizing for ChatGPT/Perplexity answers. Interesting, but you don't have enough content yet to matter.

**GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)**: Same as AEO - too early.

### Why Skip

At $15 MRR with 5 users, your bottleneck is:
1. **Validation** - Do people want personalized paths?
2. **Revenue** - Can you charge $49 for them?
3. **Distribution** - Can you find more Sofias/Chikas?

Blog posts don't solve any of these in the next 30 days.

### When to Start SEO

- After you hit $500+ MRR
- After you have 5-10 testimonials
- After you know which keywords convert (from Reddit comments)
- After you have content to repurpose (turn Reddit comments → blog posts)

### The Exception

If you write a Reddit comment that gets 50+ upvotes, turn THAT into a blog post. You've already validated the content.
