# 🚀 Kaiwa Marketing & Distribution Strategy

> **Mission**: Create urgency for people who need to connect with loved ones, not just learn a language.

## 🎯 The Core Insight

The real pain isn’t grammar — it’s relying on subtitles and translation apps as a crutch to connect. When your partner or their family becomes your interpreter, the conversation stops being yours. Kaiwa helps you move from subtitles to speaking, so connection is direct, not mediated by technology.

## 🧿 Positioning: Relationship‑Only Beachhead

- Category: Practical language for relationships (partner + family). Not generic study; not test prep.
- Promise: Rehearse the moments that define trust — meet the parents, apologize well, share life changes, give a toast — and be understood by the people you love.
- Who we’re for: Bilingual couples, new in‑laws, expats integrating into a partner’s family.
- Who we’re not for (for now): Exams, broad vocab drills, travel small talk without relationship stakes.

### Scenario Priorities (live in app)

- Meeting Your Partner’s Parents
- Repairing the Relationship
- Family Celebration Toast (toast)
- Sharing Big Life News (moving, career)
- Dinner & Drinks Date (lightweight rapport)

### Copy Principles (site, emails, posts)

- Lead with stakes (“Love shouldn’t need subtitles”).
- Show pasteable scripts; end with soft CTA (invite to Practice Lab/DM).
- Credit real feedback: “Shipped X based on Y’s rehearsal.”

## 🧪 Principle: Do Things That Don’t Scale (First 50 Users)

For now, marketing = **high‑touch work with a small number of real people**, not reach:

- Personally onboard PAB members and early users into 1–2 key scenarios (e.g., “Meet the Parents,” “Heritage Reunion”), then watch their full conversations.
- Offer 1:1 Loom reviews or short Zoom calls where you tailor scripts line‑by‑line to their real situation.
- Turn each deep session into a Case File + 1–2 public artifacts (Reddit thread, Reel, email story) that credit the user and the shipped fix.
- Manually log core usage metrics weekly (WACU, conversations per active user, real‑world conversations reported) before optimizing MRR or followers.

These “unscalable” touches are the primary marketing channel for the next few weeks; content and scalable distribution sit downstream of this loop.

## 📊 90‑Day Go‑To‑Market (Marketing × Distribution)

### Phase 1: Subtitles → Speaking (Days 1–30)

Goal: Prove the “ditch the subtitles” wedge with relationship scenarios.

- Anchor scenario: “Meet the Parents” (JP) + Apology + Sharing News.
- Produce 8–10 Case Files (before/after scripts) and run weekly Practice Lab.
- Founder 3‑day emails to convert hesitant signups to their first 3‑minute session.

### Phase 2: Community Lift (Days 31–60)

Goal: Embed where couples/expats ask for help; share pasteable scripts.

- Channels: r/movingtojapan, r/LearnJapanese, r/relationships; IG/TikTok Reels; expat FB/Discord.
- Distribution rhythm: 1 Case File crosspost/week + daily helpful comments + 3 Reels/week.

### Phase 3: Compounding Proof (Days 61–90)

Goal: Turn proofs into lightweight virality and referrals.

- Release “Tokyo Test” v1 (5‑min readiness check) and showcase anonymized results.
- Publish monthly Wins & Fixes; add referral perk for couples who bring a friend.

## 💔 Creating Urgency for Key Personas

### For The Relationship Navigator

- **The "Lost in Translation" Crisis**: "They've stopped telling you the important things because explaining is too exhausting."
- **The Parent Meeting Countdown**: "Meeting their parents in [X] days? This meeting determines everything. You get one shot."
- **The Relationship Decay Meter**: A free assessment to quantify how the language gap is affecting their relationship.

### For The Family Connector

- **The Grandparent Clock**: "Your grandmother has maybe 2 years left. She's never heard your real voice."
- **The Heritage Hemorrhage**: "You're losing 1% of your culture every month."
- **The Inheritance Conversation**: "Family decisions are being made without you."

## 🎬 Campaign Lines & Tactics

- “Love shouldn’t need subtitles.”
- “From subtitles to speaking.”
- “Turn off the interpreter; have your own conversation.”
- WhatsApp “Daily Family Phrase” (relationship contexts only).
- Dating profile badge: “Actually speaks [language] (family-approved).”

## ✅ The Simple Truth

We're not chasing points or streaks. We're replacing a tech crutch (subtitles/auto‑translate) with real speech in the moments that matter. Less drama, more practice — so you're understood by the people you love.

1. Source insight: Live sessions + community threads reveal a stuck moment.
2. Ship the fix: Improve scenario or guidance and note what changed.
3. Publish proof: Case File (pasteable script) + 30–45s Reel.
4. Distribute: Crosspost to 1–2 subs; share Reel to IG/TikTok/Shorts; reply to every comment with tailored lines.
5. Convert: Founder emails to nudge first session; Practice Lab invites in‑thread.
6. Measure: Posts → DMs → sessions → shipped fixes. Repeat weekly.

## 🧭 Reddit Growth Playbook (Value-First, No Astroturf)

> Goal: embed as a helpful contributor; run one weekly “Practice Lab” and one weekly “Case File,” with daily comment help. Links only on request or in bio.

### Target Subreddits

- Expat/Japan life: r/movingtojapan, r/japanlife, r/LifeInJapan, r/TeachingInJapan
- Language learning: r/LearnJapanese, r/LanguageLearning, r/ActualPublicSpeaking (for toast scenarios)
- Relationships (value-first only): r/relationships, r/relationship_advice, r/LongDistance
- Bilingual/culture: r/bilingual, r/translator, r/JapanLifeQuestions

### Crossposting Tactics

- Canonical → Crosspost: Publish the full “Case File” to your hub (profile or r/kaiwaJapanese), then crosspost to 1–2 relevant subs with a localized intro tailored to that sub’s pain (etiquette vs. language).
- No-link OP: Paste scripts/templates directly in the thread. If asked, reply with a link or offer DM. Respect sub rules about self‑promo.
- Pace: Max 1 top‑level post per sub per week; maintain ~10:1 comment:post ratio.
- Mod preclear: Send modmail offering a weekly free “Practice Lab” thread (no external links, templates in‑thread, optional DM for a slot). Ask for approved flair.

### Moderator Outreach (template)

```
Hi mods — founder here. I’m running a weekly free Practice Lab to help people rehearse high‑stakes Japanese conversations (meeting parents, apologies, clinic triage). No links in OP — I paste scripts and templates in‑thread and answer every question. If that’s not okay, I can share the templates without any CTA. Happy to use flair and follow any posting cadence you prefer.
```

## 🎬 Post Types That Convert Without Feeling Salesy

- Practice Lab invite: “Free ‘Meet the Parents’ rehearsal this Saturday — scripts, etiquette, live roleplays. Comment your hardest moment; I’ll prep examples.”
- Case File breakdown: “How an A2 learner handled a clinic visit in Japanese — symptom script, repair phrases, and what changed in 20 minutes.” End with: “Want the template? I’ll paste it in comments.”
- Scenario poll: “Which real convo do you dread? (Apology, dinner with parents, breaking news). I’ll build the winner and post the script here.”
- Office hours/AMA: “50+ simulated family dinners run — ask about honorifics, subtle praise, and what not to say.”

---

## 📱 Instagram / TikTok / Shorts System

- Reels/Shorts (3–4 per week): 30–45s reenactments from scenarios with on‑screen bilingual lines and a single “Try this line” CTA.
- Carousels: “Parents Dinner Checklist,” “Apology Map,” “Clinic Triage Script” — 6–8 frames; final frame invites to free Practice Lab.
- Captions: context → 3 lines to copy → soft CTA (“Comment your situation; I’ll tailor a script”).
- Cross‑posting: TikTok and YouTube Shorts with identical cuts; add Q&A sticker on IG Stories for weekly prompts.

---

## 👥 Inner Circle → Growth Flywheel

- Hour‑long sessions → Case Files: anonymized 150–250 words (situation → friction → script → outcome). Use as canonical Reddit posts and Reel scripts.
- Weekly two‑bullet update to VIP testers; credit anyone whose feedback shipped. Ask for one intro: “Know any EN–JP couples meeting parents soon? I’ll prep a free rehearsal for both of you.”
- Consent workflow: get written thumbs‑up for quotes/clips; anonymize by default.

---

## ✍️ Copy‑Ready Templates

### Case File (Partner’s Parents Dinner)

```
Title: How we rehearsed meeting my partner’s parents (JP): what to say, what to avoid

Hook: “Three lines that turned an awkward dinner into approval.”

Situation (50–70w): A2 learner, dinner at partner’s parents’ home next week; anxious about honorifics and what to say when asked about work and future plans.

Friction (40–60w): Over‑apologizing, robotic keigo, freezing when complimented.

Script (pasteable):
1) 初めまして、◯◯と申します。いつも◯◯さんにお世話になっています。
2) 今日はお時間をいただきありがとうございます。緊張していますが、とても楽しみにしていました。
3) まだ勉強中なので、失礼があったら教えてください。

Etiquette Notes: One small gift, compliment seasonal dish, short answers + ask back.

Outcome (30–50w): Learner relaxed after first volley; parents invited a second visit.

CTA (soft): If you want the full template tuned to your situation, I’ll paste it in comments or DM you.
```

### Practice Lab Invite (No‑Link OP)
