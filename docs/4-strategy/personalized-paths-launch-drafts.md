Hey [name],

Quick update: I've been testing something with a few founding members that's working really well.

Instead of random practice scenarios, I'm building personalized 2-week paths for specific situations:

- "Meeting my partner's Japanese parents next month"
- "Business trip to Mexico City in 3 weeks"
- "Actually talking to my French mother-in-law"

Here's how it works:

1. 15-min call - you tell me exactly what you're preparing for
2. I build you 14 daily scenarios tailored to YOUR situation
3. You practice with AI that knows your context
4. Mid-path check-in to adjust if needed

Opening 5 spots for December.

Interested? Reply with your situation and I'll let you know if it's a good fit.

- Hiro

PS - $49 for founding members (normally $99). Your feedback is worth more than the discount.

Thread: Why I'm only taking 5 new users this month

I've been running an experiment with @TryKaiwa

Instead of "learn Japanese" I asked:
"What SPECIFIC situation do you need to prepare for?"

The answers were wild:
- "Dinner with my boyfriend's parents in 3 weeks"
- "Job interview in Spanish next month"
- "My French mother-in-law keeps switching to English"

So I built personalized 2-week paths for each of them.

---

Here's what's different:

Generic app: "Practice ordering at a restaurant"

Personalized path: "Practice meeting Takeshi's mom, who loves cooking, will ask about your job, and appreciates when you try keigo"

One makes you practice. The other prepares you for a REAL moment.

The results so far:

[X] users actively practicing daily
[X]% completion rate
"Finally feels like I'm preparing for something real" - actual feedback

Hey everyone! Quick update on something I've been working on.

You know how Kaiwa has generic scenarios like "ordering at a restaurant"?

I realized that's not how people actually need to practice.

So I've been testing "Personalized Paths" with a few founding members:

- Robert is preparing to speak formal Japanese with strangers in Tokyo
- Chika is learning to talk to her partner's French mother
- [Others when you have them]

Each person gets a custom 14-day path built specifically for their situation.

It's working WAY better than random practice.

Opening 5 spots for December if anyone wants in:
- 15-min call to understand your situation
- I build you a custom 14 or 28-day path
- $49 for founding members

DM me with what you're preparing for, or grab a time: https://calendar.app.google/XESCmxmKpNrhzN5d7

Would love your feedback more than anything!

## Instagram/TikTok Caption

```
POV: You stop "learning Japanese" and start preparing for one specific moment

That dinner with your partner's parents.
That work trip to Mexico City.
That conversation with your grandmother you've been avoiding.

Generic apps teach you how to order coffee.

I build you a 14-day path for YOUR exact situation.

5 spots open for December.

## LinkedIn Post (if applicable)

```
I've been building a language practice app for 6 months.

Last week I realized I was solving the wrong problem.

Nobody wants to "learn Japanese."

They want to:
- Not embarrass themselves at dinner with their girlfriend's parents
- Survive a business trip without Google Translate
- Actually talk to their heritage family

So I pivoted to personalized paths.

15-min call → Custom 14-day practice plan → Built for ONE specific situation

Early results: [X]% daily completion rate (vs ~20% for generic apps)

Opening 5 spots for December. $49 for founding members.

DM if you have a specific situation coming up.

## Scarcity & Urgency Tactics (Ethical)

### Real Scarcity (use these)
- "5 spots for December" - You literally can only handle 5 manual setups
- "Founding member price" - This IS temporary
- "Your feedback is the payment" - True, you need validation

### Timeline Anchors (use these)
- "Before the holidays"
- "Preparing for [their specific event]"
- "While I'm still doing manual builds"

### Avoid
- Fake countdown timers
- "Offer ends tonight" (unless true)
- Pressure tactics that feel manipulative

---

## Follow-Up Sequences

### Day 2 (if no response)
```
Hey! Following up on the personalized path idea.

No pressure at all - just wanted to make sure you saw it in case it got buried.

If the timing isn't right or it's not a fit, totally understand!
```

### Day 5 (if still no response)
```
Last follow-up! The December spots are filling up.

If you've got a specific situation coming up (trip, family visit, etc.), happy to chat about whether a custom path would help.

If not, no worries at all - the regular Kaiwa scenarios are always there when you need them!
```

## Key Messaging Points

### What to emphasize
- **Specific > Generic**: "Built for YOUR situation"
- **Human touch**: "15-min call with me"
- **Limited**: "Only 5 spots"
- **Founding member**: Makes them feel special
- **Outcome-focused**: "Prepare for X moment"

### What to avoid
- Feature lists
- Technical details about AI
- Comparison to competitors
- Long explanations
- Desperate energy

---

## Success Metrics for Week 1

| Metric | Target | Actual |
|--------|--------|--------|
| DMs sent | 5 | |
| Responses | 3+ | |
| Calls booked | 2-3 | |
| Calls completed | 2 | |
| Paths created | 2 | |

---

## Notes

- Always personalize with their specific situation if you know it

- Every call is a learning opportunity even if they don't convert
- Document feedback for product iteration
