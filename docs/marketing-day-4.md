# Case File: How Maria Prepared to Meet Takeshi's Parents

**The Situation**:
Maria (28, graphic designer) had been dating Takeshi for 18 months. His parents were visiting from Osaka for the first time. She had 3 weeks to prepare. Her Japanese level: N4/beginner-intermediate.

**The Fear**:
"What if they think I'm not good enough for him? What if I can't express how much I love their son?"

**The Prep**:
We focused on 3 scenarios:
1. The first 5 minutes (greeting, gift giving, initial small talk)
2. The dinner table (compliments, asking questions, showing gratitude)
3. The goodbye (expressing hope to see them again, thanking them)

**The Breakthrough Moment**:
During our third practice session, Maria stopped translating in her head. She said: "I just... felt the words instead of thinking about them."

**The Result**:
After the meeting, Takeshi's mom told him (in Japanese): "She has a good heart. We can tell."

Maria texted me: "I did it. They understood me. I cried happy tears."

**The Key Insight**:
Perfect grammar doesn't build bridges. Sincere effort does.
