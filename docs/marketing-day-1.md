## Afternoon Block (90 min): Create & Post Value

### Task 3: Write Your First Value Comment (45 min)

**Pick one thread from your list and write a helpful comment**

**Template to Copy & Customize**:

```
If you're meeting your partner's parents in Japan, here are three lines that helped someone in your exact situation:

• 初めまして、[your name]と申します。いつも[partner's name]さんにお世話になっています。
  ("Nice to meet you. I'm [name]. [Partner] has been so good to me.")

• 今日はお時間をいただきありがとうございます。緊張していますが、とても楽しみにしていました。
  ("Thank you for having me today. I'm nervous, but I've been looking forward to this.")

• まだ勉強中なので、失礼があったら教えてください。
  ("I'm still learning, so please let me know if I make a mistake.")

**Cultural tips**:
- Bring a small gift (お土産) - something from your home country works great
- Compliment the seasonal dish or the home
- Keep answers short and ask questions back - shows humility

If you want help tailoring this to your specific situation, I'm happy to help. I run practice sessions for exactly this scenario.
```

**Post this comment now on the thread that resonates most.**

### Task 4: LinkedIn Founder Post (45 min)

**Your First "Building in Public" Post**

**Copy & Customize This**:

```
I'm building Kaiwa to solve a problem I lived:

I couldn't talk to my Japanese grandparents. Not really.

I knew the grammar. I passed tests. But when it came to saying "I'm proud of you" or "I miss you," I froze.

Language apps taught me "This is a pen."
They didn't teach me how to tell someone I love them.

Kaiwa is for people who need to have ONE conversation that matters:
→ Meeting your partner's parents for the first time
→ Apologizing in a way that actually heals
→ Sharing big news with family who speak another language

We're not chasing streaks or points. We're practicing the moments that define relationships.

Early beta. Messy. Real.

If you've ever felt stuck between languages and the people you love, I'd love to hear your story.

```

**Post this on LinkedIn now.**

## Copy-Paste Scripts for Common Responses

### If someone asks "What's Kaiwa?"

```
Kaiwa is a practice platform I'm building for people who need to have specific, high-stakes conversations in another language - like meeting your partner's parents, having difficult family conversations, or navigating emotional situations.

Think of it as a rehearsal space for the moments that matter most in relationships.

Still early/beta, but I'm working with people who have a conversation coming up and want to practice it safely first.

Happy to chat more if you're interested!
```

### If someone asks for more help

```
I'd be happy to help you prep for this. I run free practice sessions on Saturdays where we go through exactly this scenario.

Would you like me to send you a tailored one-page script for your specific situation? Just let me know:
- Who you're meeting (parents, grandparents, etc.)
- What you're most nervous about
- Your current Japanese level

I'll put something together you can actually use.
```

## Notes

- **Don't overthink it**: Your first post doesn't need to be perfect
- **Be helpful, not salesy**: You're offering genuine value, not pitching
- **Document everything**: You'll want to track what works
- **It's okay to feel nervous**: This is relationship-building, not spam
