2. **Decision**: What made you decide to become a founding member? What almost stopped you?

3. **Value**: What's been most valuable so far? What's been least valuable?

4. **Outcomes**: Have you had your real conversation yet? If yes, how did it go? If not, how are you feeling about it?

5. **Missing pieces**: What's missing? What would make this 10x more valuable?

6. **Pricing**: Honestly, would you pay $29/month for this? $49? What would justify that price?

7. **Referrals**: Would you recommend this to someone? Why or why not? Who specifically?

8. **Future**: If Kaiwa could do ONE thing 6 months from now that it doesn't do today, what should it be?

9. **Alternatives**: What else have you tried? What are you comparing Kaiwa to?

10. **Anything else**: What haven't I asked that I should know?
