**Script** (30-45 seconds):

```
3 things NOT to say when meeting your Japanese boyfriend's parents:

❌ "日本語が上手" (My Japanese is good)
→ Comes across as arrogant
✅ Instead: "まだ勉強中です" (I'm still learning)

❌ Over-apologizing for everything
→ "すみません" every 5 seconds feels insecure
✅ Instead: Use it thoughtfully, once or twice

❌ "I don't understand" without trying
→ Shows you're not making effort
✅ Instead: "もう一度お願いします" (Could you say that again?)

Remember: They're watching HOW you try, not IF you're perfect.

Free Practice Lab This Saturday: "Meeting Your Partner's Japanese Parents" - Rehearsal + Scripts + Cultural Tips
```

**Post Body**:

```
Hi everyone,

I've been helping people prepare for high-stakes Japanese conversations (like meeting their partner's parents), and I'm running a free Practice Lab this Saturday.

**What we'll cover**:
• The exact 3-phrase framework for the first 5 minutes
• How to handle common questions ("What do you do?" "What are your plans together?")
• Cultural tips (gifts, body language, when to speak vs listen)
• Live roleplay practice (optional - safe space, no judgment)
• Q&A for your specific situation

**Who this is for**:
• You're meeting your partner's parents soon (or thinking about it)
• Your Japanese is A2-B1 (some basics, but not fluent)
• You want to prepare so you don't freeze in the moment

**Format**:
• 45 minutes on Zoom
• Saturday [DATE] at [TIME - pick 10am or 2pm your timezone]
• Completely free
• No sales pitch - just practice and help

**To join**:
Drop a comment or DM me with:
1. Your situation (how long dating, when is the meeting, etc.)
2. Your biggest worry about the meeting
3. Your current Japanese level

I'll send you the Zoom link and a prep guide before the session.

**Note**: Keeping it small (5-6 people max) so everyone gets personalized attention.

Looking forward to helping you prepare!
```

**Action**: Post this now.

### Task 4: LinkedIn Announcement (30 min)

**LinkedIn Post**:

```
I'm running my first free Practice Lab this Saturday.

Topic: Meeting Your Partner's Japanese Parents (Without the Anxiety)

I've spent the last month talking to people preparing for this exact moment.

Here's what I learned:
• The fear isn't about grammar - it's about being judged
• People don't need 1000 words - they need the RIGHT 10 words
• Sincerity beats perfection every time

So I'm hosting a 45-minute session where we:
→ Practice the first 5 minutes (the hardest part)
→ Learn how to handle common questions
→ Roleplay in a safe space (optional)
→ Cover cultural dos and don'ts

5 spots available. Free. No pitch.

Who's this for?
• Bilingual couples preparing to meet the parents
• Japanese learners (A2-B1 level)
• Anyone who wants to practice a real conversation, not flashcards

Comment "INTERESTED" or DM me and I'll send details.

Building Kaiwa in public means inviting people into the messy, real process.

This is Day 5 of that journey.

Let's practice together.

## Copy-Paste Scripts for Today

### Response to "What level Japanese do I need?"

```
If you can introduce yourself and understand basic phrases, you're good!

This session is perfect for A2-B1 level (some basics, not fluent).

We'll practice the exact phrases you need, and I'll give you the full script in advance so you're not going in cold.

Even if you're nervous about your level, that's exactly why this practice is helpful. Want to join?
```

### Response to "I can't make Saturday"

```
No problem! When works better for you?

I'm planning to run these every week, so I can put you on the list for:
• Next Saturday (same time)
• Weeknight evening session
• Sunday afternoon

Just let me know what fits your schedule!
```

### Response to "Is this really free?"

```
Yep, completely free!

I'm in the early stages of building Kaiwa, and the best way to understand what people need is to practice with them directly.

Later I'll offer paid 1-on-1 sessions, but right now I'm gathering feedback and helping people prepare for real conversations.

No credit card, no catch. Just show up and practice.
```
